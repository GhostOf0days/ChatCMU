Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive 
    Tutor Center
  




Our 
      research focuses on the development of Cognitive Tutors -- instructional 
      systems that support guided learning-by-doing. 
Drawing from the disciplines of 
      artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology and human computer 
      interaction, we develop systems that provide individualized assistance to 
      students as they work on challenging real-world problems in complex 
      domains such as computer programming, algebra and geometry. Individualized 
      guidance is made possible using detailed computational models of skills 
      and misconceptions underlying a learning domain.
The Cognitive Tutor Algebra course is the most 
      successful PACT Center product. Originally created in the early 1990s with 
      support from NSF, DoE, Darpa, and foundations in Pittsburgh, this course 
      had reached 75 schools in 1998-99 through PACT Center dissemination. At 
      that point, we formed a spin-off company, 
Carnegie Learning, 
      that by 2003 had brought the tutors to over 1400 schools across the 
      country.
In the fall of 2004, the U.S. Department of 
	  Education "What Works Clearinghouse" 
	  analyzed research studies on 44 math programs used in grades 6-9.  Cognitive 
	  Tutor Algebra was one of only two of these programs that both met the high 
	  standards of the Clearinghouse and provided quality evidence that students 
	  learn more from these programs than from other programs.
Both teachers and students have been 
      enthusiastic about tutor use as part of the Algebra curriculum. Field 
      studies have shown dramatic student achievement gains relative to control 
      classes: 15-25% better on standardized tests of basic skills, 50-100% on 
      assessments of problem solving and representation use. The course has been 
      designated one of five exemplary curricula for K-12 mathematics educated 
      by the US Department of Education.
