I am an Assistant Professor with The Robotics Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I also hold affiliated faculty appointments in the Computer Science Department and Machine Learning Department. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning.  My ultimate goal is to build intelligent machines, capable of recreating our visual world. I study machine learning models that can learn to automatically synthesize visual content and virtual worlds by understanding and modeling millions of images and videos. Along the way, the learned models will also understand why our world looks the way it does, discovering knowledge useful for recognition and reasoning tasks.
Prior to joining CMU, I was a Research Scientist at Adobe Research. I did a postdoc at MIT CSAIL, working with William T. Freeman, Josh Tenenbaum, and Antonio Torralba. I obtained my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Alexei A. Efros. I received my B.E. from Tsinghua University. My Ph.D. research was awarded the Facebook Fellowship, ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and UC Berkeley EECS David J. Sakrison Memorial Prize for outstanding doctoral research.

I am an Assistant Professor with The Robotics Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I also hold affiliated faculty appointments in the Computer Science Department and Machine Learning Department. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning.  My ultimate goal is to build intelligent machines, capable of recreating our visual world. I study machine learning models that can learn to automatically synthesize visual content and virtual worlds by understanding and modeling millions of images and videos. Along the way, the learned models will also understand why our world looks the way it does, discovering knowledge useful for recognition and reasoning tasks.
Prior to joining CMU, I was a Research Scientist at Adobe Research. I did a postdoc at MIT CSAIL, working with William T. Freeman, Josh Tenenbaum, and Antonio Torralba. I obtained my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Alexei A. Efros. I received my B.E. from Tsinghua University. My Ph.D. research was awarded the Facebook Fellowship, ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and UC Berkeley EECS David J. Sakrison Memorial Prize for outstanding doctoral research.

I am an Assistant Professor with The Robotics Institute in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I also hold affiliated faculty appointments in the Computer Science Department and Machine Learning Department. My research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and machine learning.  My ultimate goal is to build intelligent machines, capable of recreating our visual world. I study machine learning models that can learn to automatically synthesize visual content and virtual worlds by understanding and modeling millions of images and videos. Along the way, the learned models will also understand why our world looks the way it does, discovering knowledge useful for recognition and reasoning tasks.
Prior to joining CMU, I was a Research Scientist at Adobe Research. I did a postdoc at MIT CSAIL, working with William T. Freeman, Josh Tenenbaum, and Antonio Torralba. I obtained my Ph.D. from UC Berkeley, under the supervision of Alexei A. Efros. I received my B.E. from Tsinghua University. My Ph.D. research was awarded the Facebook Fellowship, ACM SIGGRAPH Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award, and UC Berkeley EECS David J. Sakrison Memorial Prize for outstanding doctoral research. My co-authored work received NVIDIA Pioneer Research Award, and SIGGRAPH 2019 Real-time Live! “Best of Show Award” and “Audience Choice Award”.
