Laura Hudspith MFA ’23 Exhibits in ArtToronto’s Focus Exhibition
Posted on October 26, 2022
Laura Hudspith‘s work is included in “held open,” ArtToronto’s Focus Exhibition, on view at the fair October 27-30 at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.
The focus exhibition creats a context to explore and investigate the works of artists shown at the fair, and an opportunity for them to present new and often ambitious works. Here, contemporary artists are shown alongside historical works, complicating narratives and creating points of understanding contemporary concerns by examining the past.
Curated by Marie-Charlotte Carrier, “held open” explores the manifold ways we relate to one another and the non-human. They hint at what these intimacies might mean, in all their complexity and ambivalence – and in doing so, they reveal the entangled narratives and ecologies that characterize the living but also how such relationships are in constant flux. The works in the show, pulled from exhibiting galleries from across Canada and the US, offer a respite, a moment to observe what is often concealed, and at times, speculation of how these worlds might be intertwined or even collide.
