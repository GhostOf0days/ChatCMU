CMU Cloud Lab Trainings





By combining asynchronous and instructor-led interactive courses for different scientific fields, the CMU Cloud Lab training program is designed to offer a diversity of learning experiences and more flexibility toward students and researcher’s schedules.
The CMU training program focuses on three main educational points: understanding the Cloud Lab (what is a Cloud Lab, what can and cannot be performed in a Cloud Lab, how to use it), how to design and perform scientific experiments in a Cloud Lab (how to fully or partially translate an experimental workflow from the bench to the Cloud Lab) and finally how to combine the power of the Cloud lab with other tools such as computational science and open science.
 
The trainings will allow you to get the Cloud Lab certification and access the Cloud Lab to start your first experiment.

CMU Cloud Lab Trainings





By combining asynchronous and instructor-led interactive courses for different scientific fields, the CMU Cloud Lab training program is designed to offer a diversity of learning experiences and more flexibility toward students and researcher’s schedules.
The CMU training program focuses on three main educational points: understanding the Cloud Lab (what is a Cloud Lab, what can and cannot be performed in a Cloud Lab, how to use it), how to design and perform scientific experiments in a Cloud Lab (how to fully or partially translate an experimental workflow from the bench to the Cloud Lab) and finally how to combine the power of the Cloud lab with other tools such as computational science and open science.
 
The trainings will allow you to get the Cloud Lab certification and access the Cloud Lab to start your first experiment.

Cloud Lab Training Courses with Subha Das, Associate Professor of Chemistry, Mellon College of Science
Fall courses:
09621 Welcome to the Future Lab – Science in the Cloud (6 unit mini)
Description: You can be at home or anywhere in the world and still run experiments in a lab. This course is to introduce and train students in the use of an automated and remote cloud lab facility. Operations in the cloud lab are conducted through a computer console and internet access that allows the user to program equipment, set up experiments and analyze data. In this course, students will learn the steps to use the Wolfram language/Mathematica based Cloud Lab Command Center interface to remotely interact with the facilities and laboratory instruments in the cloud lab. Following training exercises, students will be able to select the appropriate equipment and reagents to prepare samples and solutions for laboratory analyses and experiments. (No prior knowledge of Mathematica is required but basic programming skills are helpful)
PREREQUISITES: None
COREQUISITES: None
09623 Future Lab – DNA Science in the Cloud (6 unit mini)
Description: This course uses an automated and remote cloud lab facility and will involve learning the steps to handle, manipulate and quantitate solutions of DNA and nucleic acids. Students will set up experiments that automate the dispensing, analysis and purification of nucleic acids and use DNA for biophysical measurements. Students will learn to remotely operate, design and execute experiments on state-of-the-art instrumentation to analyze DNA sequence and structure. Besides learning how to remotely use equipment and instruments for synthesis and analyses by spectroscopy and spectrometry, students will also learn about nucleic acids as part of their experiments. (Prior training in the use of the cloud lab is required)
PREREQUISITES: 09621
COREQUISITES: None
 
The trainings will allow you to get the Cloud Lab certification and access the Cloud Lab to start your first experiment.
