Hands-on learning inspires and prepares tomorrow’s visionariesBy  Amanda Hartle and Joyce DeFrancescoAt Carnegie Mellon University, “making” is more than a learning activity, it’s a way of life.You’ll find student makers from a diverse array of disciplines in every corner of campus, working on projects large and small in maker spaces of all kinds. Whether they’re weaving a new kind of fabric or testing the software they’ve installed in a robot, there is a place for them to put their education into practice.CMU, with the support of generous donors and sponsors, has spent nearly a decade expanding the number of maker spaces on campus, as well as the range of coursework, training and tools available to allow students to take their revolutionary ideas from start to finish — and sometimes to the marketplace.“We know that students want high-impact experiences and access to innovative tools and strategies,” says Jim Garrett, provost and chief academic officer. “Maker spaces offer interdisciplinary, hands-on and technology-driven experiences. At Carnegie Mellon, we are partnering with industry leaders like JPMorgan and Ansys to make these spaces a reality for our students and researchers so that they can shape the future of their fields.”From the arts-meets-technology environment of IDeATe to the robotics-infused resources of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space to the prototyping facilities of the TechSpark in the College of Engineering, supporters are making collaboration and innovation accessible to all CMU students. Below, explore three projects in these spaces that give students the opportunity to be creative, think boldly and make a difference.Now in its fifth year, Rethink the Rink is a multidisciplinary makeathon that challenges students to develop material solutions that enhance hockey’s safety without compromising game performance.Each year, students from across the university are presented with a range of real problems by the Pittsburgh Penguins and, with the support and expertise of project sponsor and international supplier of high-tech polymer materials Covestro, they have one week to brainstorm, refine, prototype and present their solutions. In its first year, Rethink the Rink activities resulted in the creation of a state-of-the-art dasher board design that improves energy absorption upon contact with body mass by up to 65 percent. The invention is now commercially available.With additional support from new sponsors PPG and Athletica Sport Systems, this year’s Rethink the Rink make-a-thon ran from March 7 to 11, 2022, in CMU’s TechSpark and focused on improving player safety when hitting the intersections between the glass and dasher boards.“It’s incredibly rewarding to see our students journey through the innovation process under the counsel and mentorship of the Rethink the Rink collaborators,” says Bill Sanders, the Dr. William D. and Nancy W. Strecker Dean of CMU’s College of Engineering. “I love seeing the resulting prototypes and witnessing new material and design ideas that will heighten hockey player safety.”When a robot named Fetch cut the ceremonial ribbon at grand opening of the 1,900-square-foot JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space in CMU’s Tepper Quad in November 2021, it gave students a new playground for their creativity and passion to change the world.Unlike traditional maker spaces, where students use hardware to prototype and manufacture physical items, this spaces concentrates on software development. Made possible by JPMorgan Chase & Co., the interdisciplinary facility houses distinct spaces for various areas of AI research: robotics areas, drone zone, robot playground, smart home area and a vision/speech/machine learning area. Students, regardless of major or department, have access to tools needed to study AI that are usually only found in faculty labs.Throughout the spring 2022 semester, School of Computer Science researchers Azarakhsh Keipour, Mohammadreza Mousaei, John Keller and Junyi “Jenny” Geng, who are all connected to the Robotics Institute’s AirLab, used the space’s 12-by-12-foot drone cage and OptiTrack precision tracking system’s motion-capture cameras to explore the physical interaction of aerial robots with their environments.The drone cage and cameras allowed the team a safe and reliable environment to dial in the robot’s flight path — allowing quicker progress and precise movements. After months of testing, they were able to control the aerial robot’s position and forces to write the letter “A” on a whiteboard while applying exactly 6 newtons of force.This accomplishment brings the team, and the world, one step closer to solving the complex, real-world challenges facing aerial robots and their use in everyday situations.“We want students from all over the university — from engineering, business and fine arts — to come and use their creativity to make interesting things happen,” said Reid Simmons, director, JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space. “Giving students the freedom to let their imaginations run wild is really what this space is all about.”Physical computing involves creating or using devices that interact with the world around them.

At Carnegie Mellon University, “making” is more than a learning activity, it’s a way of life.
You’ll find student makers from a diverse array of disciplines in every corner of campus, working on projects large and small in maker spaces of all kinds. Whether they’re weaving a new kind of fabric or testing the software they’ve installed in a robot, there is a place for them to put their education into practice.
CMU, with the support of generous donors and sponsors, has spent nearly a decade expanding the number of maker spaces on campus, as well as the range of coursework, training and tools available to allow students to take their revolutionary ideas from start to finish — and sometimes to the marketplace.
“We know that students want high-impact experiences and access to innovative tools and strategies,” says Jim Garrett, provost and chief academic officer. “Maker spaces offer interdisciplinary, hands-on and technology-driven experiences. At Carnegie Mellon, we are partnering with industry leaders like JPMorgan and Ansys to make these spaces a reality for our students and researchers so that they can shape the future of their fields.”
From the arts-meets-technology environment of IDeATe to the robotics-infused resources of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space to the prototyping facilities of the TechSpark in the College of Engineering, supporters are making collaboration and innovation accessible to all CMU students. Below, explore three projects in these spaces that give students the opportunity to be creative, think boldly and make a difference.








Making Hockey Safer
Now in its fifth year, Rethink the Rink is a multidisciplinary makeathon that challenges students to develop material solutions that enhance hockey’s safety without compromising game performance.

Flying Into the Future
When a robot named Fetch cut the ceremonial ribbon at grand opening of the 1,900-square-foot JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space in CMU’s Tepper Quad in November 2021, it gave students a new playground for their creativity and passion to change the world.

Throughout the spring 2022 semester, School of Computer Science researchers Azarakhsh Keipour, Mohammadreza Mousaei, John Keller and Junyi “Jenny” Geng, who are all connected to the Robotics Institute’s AirLab, used the space’s 12-by-12-foot drone cage and OptiTrack precision tracking system’s motion-capture cameras to explore the physical interaction of aerial robots with their environments.

Building Connections
Physical computing involves creating or using devices that interact with the world around them. It brings together expertise in architecture, art, civil and environmental engineering, computer science and robotics, and, at CMU, it lives in Integrative Design, Arts and Technology Network or IDeATe, as it’s more commonly known.
IDeATe advances education, research and creative practice in domains that merge technology and arts expertise. Its courses focus on hands-on collaborative learning, bring together students from many different disciplines and are taught by faculty from 15 different academic departments.
Based in the Physical Computing Lab in IDeATe’s space inside the Hunt Library, Intro to Physical Computing is a project-based course that teaches students basic technical skills, like programming and electronics, and how to apply them in creative ways in the real world. During the spring 2022 semester, students in the course worked on a collaborative project with CLASS (Community Living and Support Services) during which they identified a need for a person with disabilities and then created a solution for that need. Along with technical skills, students were able to gain experience communicating with clients and receiving feedback from end users. The clients and students came together in April to test their prototypes including the interfaces for the user to interact with the devices.
“The Physical Computing Lab has a huge selection of building materials and physical computing sensors, wires and other electronic parts that assist our class in bringing their projects to life,” says Eric Zhao, teaching assistant for IDeATe’s Intro to Physical Computing course. “It allows for a convenient space to prototype ideas with crucial components and testing equipment just a few steps away.”

At Carnegie Mellon University, “making” is more than a learning activity, it’s a way of life.
You’ll find student makers from a diverse array of disciplines in every corner of campus, working on projects large and small in maker spaces of all kinds. Whether they’re weaving a new kind of fabric or testing the software they’ve installed in a robot, there is a place for them to put their education into practice.
CMU, with the support of generous donors and sponsors, has spent nearly a decade expanding the number of maker spaces on campus, as well as the range of coursework, training and tools available to allow students to take their revolutionary ideas from start to finish — and sometimes to the marketplace.
“We know that students want high-impact experiences and access to innovative tools and strategies,” says Jim Garrett, provost and chief academic officer. “Maker spaces offer interdisciplinary, hands-on and technology-driven experiences. At Carnegie Mellon, we are partnering with industry leaders like JPMorgan and Ansys to make these spaces a reality for our students and researchers so that they can shape the future of their fields.”
From the arts-meets-technology environment of IDeATe to the robotics-infused resources of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space to the prototyping facilities of the TechSpark in the College of Engineering, supporters are making collaboration and innovation accessible to all CMU students. Below, explore three projects in these spaces that give students the opportunity to be creative, think boldly and make a difference.








Making Hockey Safer
Now in its fifth year, Rethink the Rink is a multidisciplinary makeathon that challenges students to develop material solutions that enhance hockey’s safety without compromising game performance.
Each year, students from across the university are presented with a range of real problems by the Pittsburgh Penguins and, with the support and expertise of project sponsor and international supplier of high-tech polymer materials Covestro, they have one week to brainstorm, refine, prototype and present their solutions. In its first year, Rethink the Rink activities resulted in the creation of a state-of-the-art dasher board design that improves energy absorption upon contact with body mass by up to 65 percent. The invention is now commercially available.
With additional support from new sponsors PPG and Athletica Sport Systems, this year’s Rethink the Rink make-a-thon ran from March 7 to 11, 2022, in CMU’s TechSpark and focused on improving player safety when hitting the intersections between the glass and dasher boards.
“It’s incredibly rewarding to see our students journey through the innovation process under the counsel and mentorship of the Rethink the Rink collaborators,” says Bill Sanders, the Dr. William D. and Nancy W. Strecker Dean of CMU’s College of Engineering. “I love seeing the resulting prototypes and witnessing new material and design ideas that will heighten hockey player safety.”

Flying Into the Future
When a robot named Fetch cut the ceremonial ribbon at grand opening of the 1,900-square-foot JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space in CMU’s Tepper Quad in November 2021, it gave students a new playground for their creativity and passion to change the world.
Unlike traditional maker spaces, where students use hardware to prototype and manufacture physical items, this spaces concentrates on software development. Made possible by JPMorgan Chase & Co., the interdisciplinary facility houses distinct spaces for various areas of AI research: robotics areas, drone zone, robot playground, smart home area and a vision/speech/machine learning area. Students, regardless of major or department, have access to tools needed to study AI that are usually only found in faculty labs.
Throughout the spring 2022 semester, School of Computer Science researchers Azarakhsh Keipour, Mohammadreza Mousaei, John Keller and Junyi “Jenny” Geng, who are all connected to the Robotics Institute’s AirLab, used the space’s 12-by-12-foot drone cage and OptiTrack precision tracking system’s motion-capture cameras to explore the physical interaction of aerial robots with their environments.
The drone cage and cameras allowed the team a safe and reliable environment to dial in the robot’s flight path — allowing quicker progress and precise movements. After months of testing, they were able to control the aerial robot’s position and forces to write the letter “A” on a whiteboard while applying exactly 6 newtons of force.

This accomplishment brings the team, and the world, one step closer to solving the complex, real-world challenges facing aerial robots and their use in everyday situations.
“We want students from all over the university — from engineering, business and fine arts — to come and use their creativity to make interesting things happen,” said Reid Simmons, director, JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space. “Giving students the freedom to let their imaginations run wild is really what this space is all about.”

Building Connections
Physical computing involves creating or using devices that interact with the world around them. It brings together expertise in architecture, art, civil and environmental engineering, computer science and robotics, and, at CMU, it lives in Integrative Design, Arts and Technology Network or IDeATe, as it’s more commonly known.
IDeATe advances education, research and creative practice in domains that merge technology and arts expertise. Its courses focus on hands-on collaborative learning, bring together students from many different disciplines and are taught by faculty from 15 different academic departments.
Based in the Physical Computing Lab in IDeATe’s space inside the Hunt Library, Intro to Physical Computing is a project-based course that teaches students basic technical skills, like programming and electronics, and how to apply them in creative ways in the real world. During the spring 2022 semester, students in the course worked on a collaborative project with CLASS (Community Living and Support Services) during which they identified a need for a person with disabilities and then created a solution for that need. Along with technical skills, students were able to gain experience communicating with clients and receiving feedback from end users. The clients and students came together in April to test their prototypes including the interfaces for the user to interact with the devices.
“The Physical Computing Lab has a huge selection of building materials and physical computing sensors, wires and other electronic parts that assist our class in bringing their projects to life,” says Eric Zhao, teaching assistant for IDeATe’s Intro to Physical Computing course. “It allows for a convenient space to prototype ideas with crucial components and testing equipment just a few steps away.”

Building Connections
Physical computing involves creating or using devices that interact with the world around them. It brings together expertise in architecture, art, civil and environmental engineering, computer science and robotics, and, at CMU, it lives in Integrative Design, Arts and Technology Network or IDeATe, as it’s more commonly known.
IDeATe advances education, research and creative practice in domains that merge technology and arts expertise. Its courses focus on hands-on collaborative learning, bring together students from many different disciplines and are taught by faculty from 15 different academic departments.
Based in the Physical Computing Lab in IDeATe’s space inside the Hunt Library, Intro to Physical Computing is a project-based course that teaches students basic technical skills, like programming and electronics, and how to apply them in creative ways in the real world. During the spring 2022 semester, students in the course worked on a collaborative project with CLASS (Community Living and Support Services) during which they identified a need for a person with disabilities and then created a solution for that need. Along with technical skills, students were able to gain experience communicating with clients and receiving feedback from end users. The clients and students came together in April to test their prototypes including the interfaces for the user to interact with the devices.
“The Physical Computing Lab has a huge selection of building materials and physical computing sensors, wires and other electronic parts that assist our class in bringing their projects to life,” says Eric Zhao, teaching assistant for IDeATe’s Intro to Physical Computing course. “It allows for a convenient space to prototype ideas with crucial components and testing equipment just a few steps away.”

Investing in the Student Experience
Issue 02 | Summer 2022










At Carnegie Mellon University, “making” is more than a learning activity, it’s a way of life.
You’ll find student makers from a diverse array of disciplines in every corner of campus, working on projects large and small in maker spaces of all kinds. Whether they’re weaving a new kind of fabric or testing the software they’ve installed in a robot, there is a place for them to put their education into practice.
CMU, with the support of generous donors and sponsors, has spent nearly a decade expanding the number of maker spaces on campus, as well as the range of coursework, training and tools available to allow students to take their revolutionary ideas from start to finish — and sometimes to the marketplace.
“We know that students want high-impact experiences and access to innovative tools and strategies,” says Jim Garrett, provost and chief academic officer. “Maker spaces offer interdisciplinary, hands-on and technology-driven experiences. At Carnegie Mellon, we are partnering with industry leaders like JPMorgan and Ansys to make these spaces a reality for our students and researchers so that they can shape the future of their fields.”
From the arts-meets-technology environment of IDeATe to the robotics-infused resources of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space to the prototyping facilities of the TechSpark in the College of Engineering, supporters are making collaboration and innovation accessible to all CMU students. Below, explore three projects in these spaces that give students the opportunity to be creative, think boldly and make a difference.








Making Hockey Safer
Now in its fifth year, Rethink the Rink is a multidisciplinary makeathon that challenges students to develop material solutions that enhance hockey’s safety without compromising game performance.
Each year, students from across the university are presented with a range of real problems by the Pittsburgh Penguins and, with the support and expertise of project sponsor and international supplier of high-tech polymer materials Covestro, they have one week to brainstorm, refine, prototype and present their solutions. In its first year, Rethink the Rink activities resulted in the creation of a state-of-the-art dasher board design that improves energy absorption upon contact with body mass by up to 65 percent. The invention is now commercially available.
With additional support from new sponsors PPG and Athletica Sport Systems, this year’s Rethink the Rink make-a-thon ran from March 7 to 11, 2022, in CMU’s TechSpark and focused on improving player safety when hitting the intersections between the glass and dasher boards.
“It’s incredibly rewarding to see our students journey through the innovation process under the counsel and mentorship of the Rethink the Rink collaborators,” says Bill Sanders, the Dr. William D. and Nancy W. Strecker Dean of CMU’s College of Engineering. “I love seeing the resulting prototypes and witnessing new material and design ideas that will heighten hockey player safety.”

Flying Into the Future
When a robot named Fetch cut the ceremonial ribbon at grand opening of the 1,900-square-foot JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space in CMU’s Tepper Quad in November 2021, it gave students a new playground for their creativity and passion to change the world.
Unlike traditional maker spaces, where students use hardware to prototype and manufacture physical items, this spaces concentrates on software development. Made possible by JPMorgan Chase & Co., the interdisciplinary facility houses distinct spaces for various areas of AI research: robotics areas, drone zone, robot playground, smart home area and a vision/speech/machine learning area. Students, regardless of major or department, have access to tools needed to study AI that are usually only found in faculty labs.
Throughout the spring 2022 semester, School of Computer Science researchers Azarakhsh Keipour, Mohammadreza Mousaei, John Keller and Junyi “Jenny” Geng, who are all connected to the Robotics Institute’s AirLab, used the space’s 12-by-12-foot drone cage and OptiTrack precision tracking system’s motion-capture cameras to explore the physical interaction of aerial robots with their environments.
The drone cage and cameras allowed the team a safe and reliable environment to dial in the robot’s flight path — allowing quicker progress and precise movements. After months of testing, they were able to control the aerial robot’s position and forces to write the letter “A” on a whiteboard while applying exactly 6 newtons of force.

This accomplishment brings the team, and the world, one step closer to solving the complex, real-world challenges facing aerial robots and their use in everyday situations.
“We want students from all over the university — from engineering, business and fine arts — to come and use their creativity to make interesting things happen,” said Reid Simmons, director, JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space. “Giving students the freedom to let their imaginations run wild is really what this space is all about.”

At Carnegie Mellon University, “making” is more than a learning activity, it’s a way of life.
You’ll find student makers from a diverse array of disciplines in every corner of campus, working on projects large and small in maker spaces of all kinds. Whether they’re weaving a new kind of fabric or testing the software they’ve installed in a robot, there is a place for them to put their education into practice.
CMU, with the support of generous donors and sponsors, has spent nearly a decade expanding the number of maker spaces on campus, as well as the range of coursework, training and tools available to allow students to take their revolutionary ideas from start to finish — and sometimes to the marketplace.
“We know that students want high-impact experiences and access to innovative tools and strategies,” says Jim Garrett, provost and chief academic officer. “Maker spaces offer interdisciplinary, hands-on and technology-driven experiences. At Carnegie Mellon, we are partnering with industry leaders like JPMorgan and Ansys to make these spaces a reality for our students and researchers so that they can shape the future of their fields.”
From the arts-meets-technology environment of IDeATe to the robotics-infused resources of the JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space to the prototyping facilities of the TechSpark in the College of Engineering, supporters are making collaboration and innovation accessible to all CMU students. Below, explore three projects in these spaces that give students the opportunity to be creative, think boldly and make a difference.

Making Hockey Safer
Now in its fifth year, Rethink the Rink is a multidisciplinary makeathon that challenges students to develop material solutions that enhance hockey’s safety without compromising game performance.
Each year, students from across the university are presented with a range of real problems by the Pittsburgh Penguins and, with the support and expertise of project sponsor and international supplier of high-tech polymer materials Covestro, they have one week to brainstorm, refine, prototype and present their solutions. In its first year, Rethink the Rink activities resulted in the creation of a state-of-the-art dasher board design that improves energy absorption upon contact with body mass by up to 65 percent. The invention is now commercially available.
With additional support from new sponsors PPG and Athletica Sport Systems, this year’s Rethink the Rink make-a-thon ran from March 7 to 11, 2022, in CMU’s TechSpark and focused on improving player safety when hitting the intersections between the glass and dasher boards.
“It’s incredibly rewarding to see our students journey through the innovation process under the counsel and mentorship of the Rethink the Rink collaborators,” says Bill Sanders, the Dr. William D. and Nancy W. Strecker Dean of CMU’s College of Engineering. “I love seeing the resulting prototypes and witnessing new material and design ideas that will heighten hockey player safety.”

Flying Into the Future
When a robot named Fetch cut the ceremonial ribbon at grand opening of the 1,900-square-foot JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space in CMU’s Tepper Quad in November 2021, it gave students a new playground for their creativity and passion to change the world.
Unlike traditional maker spaces, where students use hardware to prototype and manufacture physical items, this spaces concentrates on software development. Made possible by JPMorgan Chase & Co., the interdisciplinary facility houses distinct spaces for various areas of AI research: robotics areas, drone zone, robot playground, smart home area and a vision/speech/machine learning area. Students, regardless of major or department, have access to tools needed to study AI that are usually only found in faculty labs.
Throughout the spring 2022 semester, School of Computer Science researchers Azarakhsh Keipour, Mohammadreza Mousaei, John Keller and Junyi “Jenny” Geng, who are all connected to the Robotics Institute’s AirLab, used the space’s 12-by-12-foot drone cage and OptiTrack precision tracking system’s motion-capture cameras to explore the physical interaction of aerial robots with their environments.
The drone cage and cameras allowed the team a safe and reliable environment to dial in the robot’s flight path — allowing quicker progress and precise movements. After months of testing, they were able to control the aerial robot’s position and forces to write the letter “A” on a whiteboard while applying exactly 6 newtons of force.

This accomplishment brings the team, and the world, one step closer to solving the complex, real-world challenges facing aerial robots and their use in everyday situations.
“We want students from all over the university — from engineering, business and fine arts — to come and use their creativity to make interesting things happen,” said Reid Simmons, director, JPMorgan Chase & Co. AI Maker Space. “Giving students the freedom to let their imaginations run wild is really what this space is all about.”

It brings together expertise in architecture, art, civil and environmental engineering, computer science and robotics, and, at CMU, it lives in Integrative Design, Arts and Technology Network or IDeATe, as it’s more commonly known.
IDeATe advances education, research and creative practice in domains that merge technology and arts expertise. Its courses focus on hands-on collaborative learning, bring together students from many different disciplines and are taught by faculty from 15 different academic departments.

During the spring 2022 semester, students in the course worked on a collaborative project with CLASS (Community Living and Support Services) during which they identified a need for a person with disabilities and then created a solution for that need. Along with technical skills, students were able to gain experience communicating with clients and receiving feedback from end users. The clients and students came together in April to test their prototypes including the interfaces for the user to interact with the devices.
“The Physical Computing Lab has a huge selection of building materials and physical computing sensors, wires and other electronic parts that assist our class in bringing their projects to life,” says Eric Zhao, teaching assistant for IDeATe’s Intro to Physical Computing course. “It allows for a convenient space to prototype ideas with crucial components and testing equipment just a few steps away.”
