Lena Chen MFA ’22 and Michael Neumann MFA ’20 Perform and Give Artist Talk at Upcoming Festivals
Posted on November 9, 2020
MFA candidate Lena Chen and MFA alumnus Michael Neumann will perform their work “Crosswind Landing” for sindikit project’s Friday Performance Series, curated by Jaimes Mayhew. Their performance takes place on November 13 at 7 PM EST. Chen and Neumann will also give an artist talk about their collaboration for the Inverse Performance Art Festival, hosted by the Momentary and curated by Cynthia Post Hunt and Emma Saperstein. Their talk is on November 14 at 5:30 PM EST.
“Crosswind Landing” explores the desire to see and be seen. Technology collides with the gaze of the Other as an energy exchange unfolds between the artists through their phone screens. The live-streamed durational performance is an attempt to bridge the distance between intimate partners in the age of lens-mediated relationships.
