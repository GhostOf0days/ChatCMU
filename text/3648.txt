The Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D) in Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science seeks candidates with strong academic credentials and compelling research vision for tenure-track faculty appointments at the rank of assistant, associate, and full professor.S3D is an academic department with forty faculty members whose research portfolio includes software engineering, network and social media analysis, security and privacy, systems, ML/AI for social good, and related topics. These interdisciplinary topics build on core computer science, human and organizational behavior, and policy and business considerations. S3D hosts two PhD programs, two undergraduate minors, and several master’s programs, with more than a hundred affiliated graduate students. Our research and educational programs focus on the areas of societal computing and software engineering. We particularly encourage applications from candidates whose interests complement our existing expertise. This year, we especially seek applications from computer systems researchers whose work is motivated by societal needs including but not limited to: environmental sustainability, health care, economic development, or accessibility. Secondary focus areas include ethics, AI for social good, and network science/social network analysis.We are especially interested in candidates with diverse backgrounds and a demonstrated commitment to excellence and leadership in research, undergraduate and graduate teaching, and service towards building an equitable and diverse scholarly community. We seek candidates with a demonstrated track record in mentoring and nurturing students traditionally underrepresented in Computer Science. In keeping with the CRA best practices on evaluating scholarship, we pay close attention to a candidate’s educational contributions, research quality and impact, as opposed to numerical measures of productivity. Carnegie Mellon considers applicants for employment without regard to, and does not discriminate on the basis of, gender, race, protected veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and any additional legally protected status.

 Tenure-track Position in the Software and Societal Systems Department
The Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D) in Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Computer Science seeks candidates with strong academic credentials and compelling research vision for tenure-track faculty appointments at the rank of assistant, associate, and full professor.
S3D is an academic department with forty faculty members whose research portfolio includes software engineering, network and social media analysis, security and privacy, systems, ML/AI for social good, and related topics. These interdisciplinary topics build on core computer science, human and organizational behavior, and policy and business considerations. S3D hosts two PhD programs, two undergraduate minors, and several master’s programs, with more than a hundred affiliated graduate students. 
Our research and educational programs focus on the areas of societal computing and software engineering. We particularly encourage applications from candidates whose interests complement our existing expertise. This year, we especially seek applications from computer systems researchers whose work is motivated by societal needs including but not limited to: environmental sustainability, health care, economic development, or accessibility. Secondary focus areas include ethics, AI for social good, and network science/social network analysis.
We are especially interested in candidates with diverse backgrounds and a demonstrated commitment to excellence and leadership in research, undergraduate and graduate teaching, and service towards building an equitable and diverse scholarly community. We seek candidates with a demonstrated track record in mentoring and nurturing students traditionally underrepresented in Computer Science. In keeping with the CRA best practices on evaluating scholarship, we pay close attention to a candidate’s educational contributions, research quality and impact, as opposed to numerical measures of productivity. 
Carnegie Mellon considers applicants for employment without regard to, and does not discriminate on the basis of, gender, race, protected veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and any additional legally protected status.
