 Why NREC? 








 








 Featured Projects 


UGV and UAV Collaboration
Optionally piloted helicopter teamed up with an unmanned ground vehicle to autonomously survey sites for radiation as well as biological or chemical contamination. 


Stress Testing for Autonomous Systems
NREC developed the Stress Testing for Autonomy Architectures (ASTAA) tool to find safety problems in autonomy systems that are unlikely to be discovered by other types of tests or extended field testing.
