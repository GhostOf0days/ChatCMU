Congratulations to members of Changliu Liu’s Intelligent Control Lab Alvin Shek, Bo Ying Su and Rui Chen for winning the 2023 ICRA Outstanding Interaction Paper Award! For robots to be effectively deployed in novel environments and tasks, they must be able to understand the feedback expressed by humans during intervention. This can either correct undesirable behavior or indicate additional preferences. Existing methods either require repeated episodes of interactions or assume prior known reward features, which is data-inefficient and can hardly transfer to new tasks. We relax these assumptions by describing human tasks in terms of object-centric sub-tasks and interpreting physical interventions in relation to specific objects.Read more about the award winning method on Alvin Shek’s Github page.ABOUTDiversity, Equity and InclusionHiring Faculty PositionsHistory of the Robotics InstituteMaps, Directions & ParkingRI Branding & IdentityDiversity, Equity and InclusionHiring Faculty PositionsHistory of the Robotics InstituteMaps, Directions & ParkingRI Branding & IdentityPEOPLEAllFacultySpecial FacultyPostdocsStaffInstitute StaffProject StaffStudentsPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesVisitorsAdjunct Faculty and AffiliatesAlumniAllFacultySpecial FacultyPostdocsStaffInstitute StaffProject StaffInstitute StaffProject StaffStudentsPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesVisitorsAdjunct Faculty and AffiliatesAlumniRESEARCHResearchPublicationsCentersLabs & GroupsProjectsRobotsResearchPublicationsCentersLabs & GroupsProjectsRobotsEDUCATIONAcademic ProgramsBachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)CoursesCMU Student ServicesRI Student LifeRI Summer ScholarsAcademic ProgramsBachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)Bachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramAdditional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)CoursesCMU Student ServicesRI Student LifeRI Summer ScholarsNEWSVideosVideosEVENTSAll EventsSeminarsStudent TalksSpecial EventsFaculty EventsStaff EventsRobotics Institute Seminar VideosAll EventsSeminarsStudent TalksSpecial EventsFaculty EventsStaff EventsRobotics Institute Seminar VideosNREC

ICRA Outstanding Interaction Paper Award

June 7, 2023    

Congratulations to members of Changliu Liu’s Intelligent Control Lab Alvin Shek, Bo Ying Su and Rui Chen for winning the 2023 ICRA Outstanding Interaction Paper Award!
 
The paper “Learning from Physical Human Feedback: An Object-Centric One-Shot Adaptation Method” received the 2023 ICRA Outstanding Interaction Paper award.
For robots to be effectively deployed in novel environments and tasks, they must be able to understand the feedback expressed by humans during intervention. This can either correct undesirable behavior or indicate additional preferences. Existing methods either require repeated episodes of interactions or assume prior known reward features, which is data-inefficient and can hardly transfer to new tasks. We relax these assumptions by describing human tasks in terms of object-centric sub-tasks and interpreting physical interventions in relation to specific objects.
