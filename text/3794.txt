The World Economic Forum is a not-for-profit foundation committed to improving the state of the world. The forum brings together business, government, academic and civil society leaders from around the world to help shape global, regional and industry agendas. Best known for their Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, the forum also hosts the Annual Meeting of the New Champions every summer in Dalian or Tianjin, China. CMU faculty members have had an unusually strong representation in these meetings, leading discussions, giving talks, demonstrating technology and adding their distinctive expertise to those of other world leaders. Also, CMU is one of only 29 universities in the world, 12 in the U.S., that make up the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF). GULF provides a unique platform for the world's top universities to discuss higher education and research while helping to shape the World Economic Forum agenda. GULF also fosters discussion on global policy issues between these universities, the business community and a broad range of stakeholders.Henny AdmoniFarnam Jahanian Illah NourbakhshGabriel O'DonnellAnne Wright
