 Tech Quick Start for Faculty and Staff
Welcome to Carnegie Mellon University! Use this page during your first few weeks to learn how to take advantage of the university-wide computing resources available to you. This guide may also be helpful if you're setting up a new computer.
If you can’t find what you need, visit Help and Support.
 Connect to the Network
The university offers several fast and secure network options, including both wired and wireless.
If you’re connecting off campus, we recommend connecting to the university’s Virtual Private Network (VPN) to access on-campus resources and provide additional security.
 Secure Your Devices, Accounts, and Files
Take control of your technology, and update your operating system and apps. Install CrowdStrike for advanced protection. CrowdStrike is a requirement for university-owned computers. It’s the easiest way to keep your information, and the university’s shared resources, safe from cybersecurity threats.
 Set Up Your Email and Calendar
Your email address is your Andrew userID followed by “@andrew.cmu.edu.” We offer mail and calendar services through Google.

 Find Software You Need
Faculty and staff have access to our extensive software catalog, which includes: 

Productivity software, like Microsoft Office and Google Workspace for Education.
Collaboration software, like Box, Google Chat, and Zoom.

Some software applications are available for download to your computer, while others are only available in computer labs or through Virtual Andrew or Timeshare Linux.
You also have free access to LinkedIn Learning, a platform that offers thousands of short training videos on topics ranging from Microsoft Office to leadership and more.
Note: Your department may also offer access to additional specialized software to support your work. Speak with your supervisor to learn what’s available to you.

 Tech Quick Start for Faculty and Staff
Welcome to Carnegie Mellon University! Use this page during your first few weeks to learn how to take advantage of the university-wide computing resources available to you. This guide may also be helpful if you're setting up a new computer.
If you can’t find what you need, visit Help and Support.
 Connect to the Network
The university offers several fast and secure network options, including both wired and wireless.
If you’re connecting off campus, we recommend connecting to the university’s Virtual Private Network (VPN) to access on-campus resources and provide additional security.
 Secure Your Devices, Accounts, and Files
Take control of your technology, and update your operating system and apps. Install CrowdStrike for advanced protection. CrowdStrike is a requirement for university-owned computers. It’s the easiest way to keep your information, and the university’s shared resources, safe from cybersecurity threats.
 Set Up Your Email and Calendar
Your email address is your Andrew userID followed by “@andrew.cmu.edu.” We offer mail and calendar services through Google.
