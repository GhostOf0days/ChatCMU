Professor Duesing’s Work Screened at the TAP Center for Creativity in Canada
Posted on February 27, 2023
Professor James Duesing‘s animation “Tugging the Worm” is included in the screening program “Animated Frames Volume 2” at the TAP Center for Creativity in London, Ontario on March 3. The program is a selection of international animated shorts curated by Sebastian Di Trolio and features work that was originally produced on 16mm film. The print of Tugging the Worm that will be screened for this exhibition is on loan from the Museum of Modern Art’s collection.
“Tugging the Worm” (1987) is an allegorical film that takes place in a utopian society which has faced the prospect that complete annihilation is an ever present possibility. Cork, an innocent bird-like creature, in a militaristic world that is dominated by high fasion and flashy billboards is befriended by the not too trustworthy bad boy named Vouku. Vouku’s tendency toward violent entertainment and vehicular homicide only serve to increase Cork’s angst. After a trip to the game their attitudes are changed by a vision of angels dancing at a ho-down on the head of a needle.
