Current Project: #JustRecovery: What Impact are Covid 19 Relief and Recovery Efforts Having on Social Justice and Equity Gaps?  Ambassador Mendelson, Heinz students and in partnership with a number of universities and thought partners, are looking at social justice gaps using open data sets in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Toronto.  This work addresses a number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is supported by The Rockefeller Foundation, through grants to CMU, as an outgrowth of the Brookings Institution and The Rockefeller Foundation Flagship “17 Rooms” exercise.  Together with students, we are translating the data into SDG targets and then actual numbers of people to identify who is experiencing social justice gaps and who is being left behind.  The need for more disaggregated data by race and gender as well as the need for more transparency in the distribution of Covid relief and recovery packages are emerging as preliminary findings and critical issues that, if not remedied, could impede a just recovery as well as progress on the SDGs in these cities in the wake of the pandemic.  This project also involves the creation of a Community of Practice to teach and partner with the next generation, Cohort 2030, on social justice and human rights using the SDGs and disaggregated data.  The project touches on numerous SDGs including SDG 16 (access to justice and combating corruption); SDG 2 (addressing food insecurity); SDG 3 (health and wellbeing); SDG 4 (educating the next generation about the SDGs); SDG 5 (gender); SDG 10 (reducing inequalities); SDG 11 (sustainable cities); and SDG 17 (university partnership to advance the SDGs).

Research Areas

Current Project: #JustRecovery: What Impact are Covid 19 Relief and Recovery Efforts Having on Social Justice and Equity Gaps?  Ambassador Mendelson, Heinz students and in partnership with a number of universities and thought partners, are looking at social justice gaps using open data sets in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Toronto.  This work addresses a number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is supported by The Rockefeller Foundation, through grants to CMU, as an outgrowth of the Brookings Institution and The Rockefeller Foundation Flagship “17 Rooms” exercise.  Together with students, we are translating the data into SDG targets and then actual numbers of people to identify who is experiencing social justice gaps and who is being left behind.  The need for more disaggregated data by race and gender as well as the need for more transparency in the distribution of Covid relief and recovery packages are emerging as preliminary findings and critical issues that, if not remedied, could impede a just recovery as well as progress on the SDGs in these cities in the wake of the pandemic.  This project also involves the creation of a Community of Practice to teach and partner with the next generation, Cohort 2030, on social justice and human rights using the SDGs and disaggregated data.  The project touches on numerous SDGs including SDG 16 (access to justice and combating corruption); SDG 2 (addressing food insecurity); SDG 3 (health and wellbeing); SDG 4 (educating the next generation about the SDGs); SDG 5 (gender); SDG 10 (reducing inequalities); SDG 11 (sustainable cities); and SDG 17 (university partnership to advance the SDGs).

Research Areas

Current Project: #JustRecovery: What Impact are Covid 19 Relief and Recovery Efforts Having on Social Justice and Equity Gaps?  Ambassador Mendelson, Heinz students and in partnership with a number of universities and thought partners, are looking at social justice gaps using open data sets in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Toronto.  This work addresses a number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is supported by The Rockefeller Foundation, through grants to CMU, as an outgrowth of the Brookings Institution and The Rockefeller Foundation Flagship “17 Rooms” exercise.  Together with students, we are translating the data into SDG targets and then actual numbers of people to identify who is experiencing social justice gaps and who is being left behind.  The need for more disaggregated data by race and gender as well as the need for more transparency in the distribution of Covid relief and recovery packages are emerging as preliminary findings and critical issues that, if not remedied, could impede a just recovery as well as progress on the SDGs in these cities in the wake of the pandemic.  This project also involves the creation of a Community of Practice to teach and partner with the next generation, Cohort 2030, on social justice and human rights using the SDGs and disaggregated data.  The project touches on numerous SDGs including SDG 16 (access to justice and combating corruption); SDG 2 (addressing food insecurity); SDG 3 (health and wellbeing); SDG 4 (educating the next generation about the SDGs); SDG 5 (gender); SDG 10 (reducing inequalities); SDG 11 (sustainable cities); and SDG 17 (university partnership to advance the SDGs).

Current Project: #JustRecovery: What Impact are Covid 19 Relief and Recovery Efforts Having on Social Justice and Equity Gaps?  Ambassador Mendelson, Heinz students and in partnership with a number of universities and thought partners, are looking at social justice gaps using open data sets in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, and Toronto.  This work addresses a number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is supported by The Rockefeller Foundation, through grants to CMU, as an outgrowth of the Brookings Institution and The Rockefeller Foundation Flagship “17 Rooms” exercise.  Together with students, we are translating the data into SDG targets and then actual numbers of people to identify who is experiencing social justice gaps and who is being left behind.  The need for more disaggregated data by race and gender as well as the need for more transparency in the distribution of Covid relief and recovery packages are emerging as preliminary findings and critical issues that, if not remedied, could impede a just recovery as well as progress on the SDGs in these cities in the wake of the pandemic.  This project also involves the creation of a Community of Practice to teach and partner with the next generation, Cohort 2030, on social justice and human rights using the SDGs and disaggregated data.  The project touches on numerous SDGs including SDG 16 (access to justice and combating corruption); SDG 2 (addressing food insecurity); SDG 3 (health and wellbeing); SDG 4 (educating the next generation about the SDGs); SDG 5 (gender); SDG 10 (reducing inequalities); SDG 11 (sustainable cities); and SDG 17 (university partnership to advance the SDGs).
