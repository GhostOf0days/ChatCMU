MFA Class of ’23 Exhibits at YSU’s McDonough Museum of Art
Posted on January 12, 2022
“There are seams in purgatory” is a collaborative exhibition between the five woman-identifying artists that make up Carnegie Mellon’s MFA Class of 2023: Sarah Bowling, Laura Hudspith, Rosabel Rosalind, Rebecca Shapass, and Caroline Yoo participating with her artist collective Han Diaspora Group. The exhibition is on view at Youngstown State University’s McDonough Museum of Art, January 21 through March 5.
