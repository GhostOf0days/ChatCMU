SPUR does participate in a program designed to increase the participation of underrepresented groups (including racial/ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, economically disadvantaged students, veterans, and students with disabilities) in graduate school training by providing undergraduate students with some research apprenticeship experience during the summer.The SPUR program allows talented undergraduates to spend 8 weeks during the summer in a research laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University. Each student will receive a fellowship stipend of $3,000 and apartment-style housing will be provided. Guidance and supervision of the research project will be provided by a faculty member as well as, in some cases, a postdoctoral fellow and/or advanced graduate student.  Admitted students will also participate in the Go Research! Summer Program at CMU. This program brings undergraduate researchers from across departments together in apartment-style dorms with resident assistants to facilitate community building, manage housing, and provide programming.  A Summer Seminar Series is provided for all students to help prepare for graduate education and research careers.Please note that due to program funding requirements, only U.S. citizens or permanent residents who will be currently enrolled as a continuing undergraduate student at the time of the program (8 weeks June–Aug 2023) can participate in SPUR.The application deadline is February 24, 2023.Director, Summer Program for Undergraduate Researchers

SPUR does participate in a program designed to increase the participation of underrepresented groups (including racial/ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, economically disadvantaged students, veterans, and students with disabilities) in graduate school training by providing undergraduate students with some research apprenticeship experience during the summer.
The SPUR program allows talented undergraduates to spend 8 weeks during the summer in a research laboratory at Carnegie Mellon University. Each student will receive a fellowship stipend of $3,000 and apartment-style housing will be provided. Guidance and supervision of the research project will be provided by a faculty member as well as, in some cases, a postdoctoral fellow and/or advanced graduate student.  Admitted students will also participate in the Go Research! Summer Program at CMU. This program brings undergraduate researchers from across departments together in apartment-style dorms with resident assistants to facilitate community building, manage housing, and provide programming.  A Summer Seminar Series is provided for all students to help prepare for graduate education and research careers.
Please note that due to program funding requirements, only U.S. citizens or permanent residents who will be currently enrolled as a continuing undergraduate student at the time of the program (8 weeks June–Aug 2023) can participate in SPUR.
 
SPUR Application
The application deadline is February 24, 2023.

Please note that due to program funding requirements, only U.S. citizens or permanent residents who will be currently enrolled as a continuing undergraduate student at the time of the program (8 weeks June–Aug 2023) can participate in SPUR.
