MoralityPlay_Newsletter Week 8
THIS WEEK (3/4/13 – 3/8/13)
Filming
At the beginning of this week, we secured an actor and location for the corporate executive role.  By the end of the week, we had the scene filmed, edited, and implemented into a prototype website.  In addition to completing the first iteration of the corporate executive scene, we recorded the voice over for the Occupy Wall Street scene.  This allowed us to implement the Occupy scene into the prototype website as well.
Web Progress
Major milestones were accomplished this week.  We completed the UI design which enabled us to prototype a working web design in Flash.  With the working Flash prototype in place, we were able to establish the web skeleton in HTML5.  Major progress was made with our HTML5 info graphics as well.  We completed three prototype info graphics in HTML5, and one other type of info graphic in Flash.  With the prototype websites working, and the prototype info graphics in place, we are where we want to be for preparation for halves presentations.
NEXT WEEK (3/18/13-3/22/13)
We will prepare for halves presentations next week and we will continue to work on adding more features into the prototyped websites.  Our group is scheduled to present on Friday, so we will continue to work toward adding material and content up until halves rehearsals.
