The MFA curriculum requires three consecutive years in residence. During all three years, students focus on extensive studio time, and meet weekly to critique and discuss their work with peers, faculty, visiting artists, critics, and curators.
In the first year, students enroll in two Critical Studies seminars, which encourage students to critically read, research, and incorporate art history, theory, and criticism into their writing and artistic practice. The second year introduces Contextual Practice, wherein students produce project-based and collaborative experimental works that creatively expand the role of art in the public sphere, while meaningfully engaging with new contexts and communities. During the Spring semester of the second year, students begin work on the written thesis, which allows them to explore the historical, social, and theoretical positions relevant to their studio practice. The third year allows for continued progress on the written thesis alongside studio work toward the thesis exhibition; together, the exhibition and written thesis serve as the capstone of the degree.
In addition to coursework, all students in the program hold a graduate assistantship each semester. These assistantships allow students to gain extensive experience in teaching, research, and course development.
