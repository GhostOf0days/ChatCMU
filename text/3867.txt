                    Alessandro Acquisti is the Trustees Professor of Information
                    Technology and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University's
                    Heinz College. His research combines economics, behavioral
                    research, and data mining to investigate the role of privacy
                    in a digital society. His studies have promoted the revival
                    of the economics of privacy, advanced the application of
                    behavioral economics to the understanding of consumer
                    privacy valuations and decision-making, and spearheaded the
                    investigation of privacy and disclosures in social media.

                    Cybersecurity Award for Innovation, the Heinz College School
                    of Information's Teaching Excellence Award, and numerous
                    Best Paper awards. His studies have been published in
                    journals across multiple disciplines, including Science,
                    Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Journal of
                    Economic Literature, Management Science, Marketing Science,
                    and Journal of Consumer Research. His research has been

                    the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, NPR, CNN, and
                    60 Minutes. His TED talks on privacy and human behaviour
