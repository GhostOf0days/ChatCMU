What is the CMU-Robotics Institute Summer Scholar Program?
The Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS) Program is an intensive summer research program for talented undergraduate students. Summer Scholars have the opportunity to participate in state-of-the-art robotics & AI research projects, interact with a diverse research team, and be mentored by leading faculty and technical staff. The program introduces aspiring students to dynamic research resources and methods, CMU graduate education programs, and research projects.  RISS is a committed community.  We strongly encourage applications from applicants that want to participate in and learn collaboratively. 
RISS is an undergraduate program. Applicants should be current undergraduate students with at least one full semester remaining after the RISS summer session for which they are applying.

The RI Summer Scholar Program welcomes students from around the world to our labs and classrooms. Most non-US participants apply for a J-1 intern visa sticker. Once you are accepted into the program, Carnegie Mellon will help you obtain the correct visa documents.
I am an international student, and I was part of the RISS cohort last year. Do I need to do anything differently for the J-1 Intern visa?
You will only need to include that information on your J-1 Intern checklist and include a copy of your previous DS-2019 in the paperwork that you mail to CMU for this year’s cohort.
What are the English requirements for international students?
English requirements for J-1 Intern Visa Documents are set by the U.S. Department of State regulations.
Provide a TOEFL score card with a score of over 100.  Or an English Language interview will be conducted during the final stages of the interview and selection process.  A lab member of RI staff member will work with you directly.  
What is the TIPP form (Training/Internship Placement Plan Form)?
The TIPP Form is required to process the J-1 Intern document at CMU. You will receive an email from the Robotics Institute after you accept your offer. This email will contain instructions on how to begin the immigration process.
What if the RI Summer Scholars Program does not fulfill a requirement of my graduation at my home university?
As part of the J-1 intern status, this internship must fulfill a part of your degree program. Otherwise, you may not qualify for a J-1 Intern visa according to the U.S. Department of State regulations.
I don’t have an up-to-date passport. Will this delay processing?
Yes. You must have an up-to-date passport to get your DS-2019. If you do not have an up-to-date passport, your processing will be delayed. Please check with your passport authority government for expedited processing options.
How do I obtain health insurance while I’m in the Summer Scholars’ cohort?
Please see the following site for insurance information while you are at CMU: http://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/index.html You may also want to explore options with your home institution and providers of international health insurance.
When should I buy my airplane ticket?
International students who need CMU immigration documents should not purchase an airline ticket until they have received a visa sticker in their passport.
How long will CMU take to process the J-1 Request and DS-2019 document?
A minimum of 90 – 75 days before your internship start date is required by the CMU Office of International Education (OIE) to process the J-1 Visa request and DS-2019 document.
What is the CMU-Robotics Institute Summer Scholar Program?
The Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute Summer Scholars (RISS) Program is an intensive summer research program for talented undergraduate students. Summer Scholars have the opportunity to participate in state-of-the-art robotics & AI research projects, interact with a diverse research team, and be mentored by leading faculty and technical staff. The program introduces aspiring students to dynamic research resources and methods, CMU graduate education programs, and research projects.  RISS is a committed community.  We strongly encourage applications from applicants that want to participate in and learn collaboratively. 
RISS is an undergraduate program. Applicants should be current undergraduate students with at least one full semester remaining after the RISS summer session for which they are applying. The program is not intended for high school students, graduate students, or students that will not have at least one full semester of undergraduate studies post-RISS. Both US & international may apply.
