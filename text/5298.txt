MoralityPlay_Newsletter Week 11THIS WEEK (4/1/13 – 4/5/13)
Flash and HTML 5 Web Sites
We have pushing hard to have our website up and running for playtesting purposes.  Our flash site is, for the most part, finished, while our HTML 5 site still needs additional work.  We are confident that we will have both fully functional in the very near future.Infographics
We have fixed a few issues with the wording of the infographics we showed at Halves, and now they are clearer and more easily understood.  Additionally, we have laid the foundations for new infographics to display intriguing and informative statistics.Client Meeting
We met with our client on Thursday to informally update them on our progress.  We gave a condensed version of our Halves presentation, and they were impressed by what we have been able to accomplish.  They gave valuable feedback about the flow of the story, in particular how the experience will give a call to action to our guest.Filming
Interviews with both students on main campus and Hedrick Smith, the author of Who Stole the American Dream?, have been conducted and will be integrated in the final experience.  The views expressed range far and wide and will provide an incredible glimpse into both how people perceive the economy and the cold, hard facts as to why the country is in the current situation.NEXT WEEK (4/8/13 – 4/12/13)
We are a little behind, but we are making up for lost time.  We are going to film Councilman Lavelle on Monday, a union leader on Tuesday, and we are waiting to hear back from Allan Meltzer, a conservation economist to provide balance to the discussion.  We will then edit this footage, as well as the students answers, and put it all onto the website.  The infographics should done and ready to also be put into the website.  We are getting close, but we need to keep pushing hard.Your email address will not be published.
