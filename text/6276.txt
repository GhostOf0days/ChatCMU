Students, Faculty and Staff Exhibit in Show Examining the Pittsburgh Contemporary Arts Scene
Posted on February 6, 2023
Several School of Art students, faculty, and alumni are featured in an exhibition seeking to provide a glimpse into Pittsburgh’s art scene. “Everything Once Arranged Has Become Scattered,” organized and curated by Virginia Commonwealth University’s Applied Curatorial Practices course, in on view at The Anderson in Richmond, VA from February 3 through March 3.
CMU participants are: MFA students Rebecca Shapass and Laura Hudspith; faculty Ross Mantle (CFA photography), Kim Beck, Isla Hansen, and Alisha Wormsley; and alumni Sarah Kim and Jamie Earnest.
