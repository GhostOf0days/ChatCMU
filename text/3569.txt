This paper introduces an efficient direct visual odometry (VO) algorithm
using points and lines. Pixels on lines are generally adopted in direct
methods. However, the original photometric error is only defined for
points. It seems difficult to extend it to lines. In previous works, the
collinear constraints for points on lines are either ignored [1] or
introduce heavy computational load into the resulting optimization system
[2]. This paper extends the photometric error for lines. We prove that the
3D points of the points on a 2D line are determined by the inverse depths
of the endpoints of the 2D line, and derive a closed-form solution for
this problem. This property can significantly reduce the number of
variables to speed up the optimization, and can make the collinear
constraint exactly satisfied. Furthermore, we introduce a two-step method
to further accelerate the optimization, and prove the convergence of this
method. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art direct VO algorithms.

Abstract

This paper introduces an efficient direct visual odometry (VO) algorithm
using points and lines. Pixels on lines are generally adopted in direct
methods. However, the original photometric error is only defined for
points. It seems difficult to extend it to lines. In previous works, the
collinear constraints for points on lines are either ignored [1] or
introduce heavy computational load into the resulting optimization system
[2]. This paper extends the photometric error for lines. We prove that the
3D points of the points on a 2D line are determined by the inverse depths
of the endpoints of the 2D line, and derive a closed-form solution for
this problem. This property can significantly reduce the number of
variables to speed up the optimization, and can make the collinear
constraint exactly satisfied. Furthermore, we introduce a two-step method
to further accelerate the optimization, and prove the convergence of this
method. The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art direct VO algorithms.
