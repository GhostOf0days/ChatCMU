Carnegie Mellon University is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EEO/AA).The university bases its employment decisions on the principle of equal employment opportunity. All personnel actions including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, transfer, layoff, return from layoff, education tuition assistance and social and recreational programs are administered in accordance with the university's commitment to non-discrimination.Further, the university takes affirmative action to attract qualified candidates for employment who are minority, female, individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam Era; ensures that bona fide job-related and valid requirements are used to evaluate employees for promotion and applicants for employment; and complies with applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, orders and regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, age, national or ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status or non-job-related disability.This EEO/AA policy is a reminder of our commitment to equal opportunity and as an update on current responsibilities.The university recognizes that its success depends on the development and use of the full range of human resources. At the basis of this precept is equal employment opportunity. It is critical that Carnegie Mellon's faculty, staff and student body continue to cultivate and enhance its diversity. Through administration of this and related policies, the university intends to assure that all people are included in the diversity that makes Carnegie Mellon stronger in sustaining world-class distinction.The university does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in employment by Executive Order 11246, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and other federal, state and local laws. Consistent with the university's Policy Against Retaliation, employees and applicants are protected from harassment, threats, coercion, intimidation, interference, discrimination, or retaliation for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation under the above statutes and executive order.The U.S. Department of Labor, including the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is responsible for the external administration and enforcement of the applicable federal laws, rules and regulations cited in this policy.This policy was developed by Equal Opportunity Services and incorporates suggestions by the president, general counsel, vice president for business and planning, assistant vice president for human resources and director for equal opportunity services.Equal employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top management leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer responsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This responsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department heads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO/AA as a critical component of university operations.The broad-based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal employment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non-discrimination and affirmative action are everyone's responsibility.In support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity commitments, the Office of Human Resources has been charged with responsibility for coordination of the university's EEO/AA programs, which includes: developing and implementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the attention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans and monitoring and reporting results; and handling or referring complaints to appropriate university access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external organizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action issues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, as well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA).Other individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO/AA include:

Policy Statement
Carnegie Mellon University is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EEO/AA).
The university bases its employment decisions on the principle of equal employment opportunity. All personnel actions including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, transfer, layoff, return from layoff, education tuition assistance and social and recreational programs are administered in accordance with the university's commitment to non-discrimination.
Further, the university takes affirmative action to attract qualified candidates for employment who are minority, female, individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam Era; ensures that bona fide job-related and valid requirements are used to evaluate employees for promotion and applicants for employment; and complies with applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, orders and regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, age, national or ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status or non-job-related disability.
Reason for the Policy
This EEO/AA policy is a reminder of our commitment to equal opportunity and as an update on current responsibilities.
The university recognizes that its success depends on the development and use of the full range of human resources. At the basis of this precept is equal employment opportunity. It is critical that Carnegie Mellon's faculty, staff and student body continue to cultivate and enhance its diversity. Through administration of this and related policies, the university intends to assure that all people are included in the diversity that makes Carnegie Mellon stronger in sustaining world-class distinction.
Regulatory Compliance
The university does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in employment by Executive Order 11246, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and other federal, state and local laws. Consistent with the university's Policy Against Retaliation, employees and applicants are protected from harassment, threats, coercion, intimidation, interference, discrimination, or retaliation for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation under the above statutes and executive order.
The U.S. Department of Labor, including the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is responsible for the external administration and enforcement of the applicable federal laws, rules and regulations cited in this policy.
Accountability
This policy was developed by Equal Opportunity Services and incorporates suggestions by the president, general counsel, vice president for business and planning, assistant vice president for human resources and director for equal opportunity services.
Equal employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top management leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer responsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This responsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department heads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO/AA as a critical component of university operations.
Responsibility
The broad-based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal employment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non-discrimination and affirmative action are everyone's responsibility.
In support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity commitments, the Office of Human Resources has been charged with responsibility for coordination of the university's EEO/AA programs, which includes: developing and implementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the attention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans and monitoring and reporting results; and handling or referring complaints to appropriate university access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external organizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action issues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, as well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA).
Other individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO/AA include:



Farnam Jahanian, president, 412-268-2200
Involved in all queries concerning the application of our non-discrimination policy as it applies to educational programming, and works with the university's Faculty Review Committee to resolve complaints regarding the application of Carnegie Mellon's policies as they apply to faculty.


University Ombudsperson, 412-268-1018
The ombudsperson hears complaints, clarifies issues and suggests possible solutions to work-related problems.

Policy Statement
Carnegie Mellon University is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EEO/AA).
The university bases its employment decisions on the principle of equal employment opportunity. All personnel actions including, but not limited to, recruitment, hiring, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, transfer, layoff, return from layoff, education tuition assistance and social and recreational programs are administered in accordance with the university's commitment to non-discrimination.
Further, the university takes affirmative action to attract qualified candidates for employment who are minority, female, individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans and veterans of the Vietnam Era; ensures that bona fide job-related and valid requirements are used to evaluate employees for promotion and applicants for employment; and complies with applicable federal, state and local laws, statutes, orders and regulations prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, age, national or ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status or non-job-related disability.
Reason for the Policy
This EEO/AA policy is a reminder of our commitment to equal opportunity and as an update on current responsibilities.
The university recognizes that its success depends on the development and use of the full range of human resources. At the basis of this precept is equal employment opportunity. It is critical that Carnegie Mellon's faculty, staff and student body continue to cultivate and enhance its diversity. Through administration of this and related policies, the university intends to assure that all people are included in the diversity that makes Carnegie Mellon stronger in sustaining world-class distinction.
Regulatory Compliance
The university does not discriminate and is required not to discriminate in employment by Executive Order 11246, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and other federal, state and local laws. Consistent with the university's Policy Against Retaliation, employees and applicants are protected from harassment, threats, coercion, intimidation, interference, discrimination, or retaliation for filing a complaint or assisting in an investigation under the above statutes and executive order.
The U.S. Department of Labor, including the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is responsible for the external administration and enforcement of the applicable federal laws, rules and regulations cited in this policy.
Accountability
This policy was developed by Equal Opportunity Services and incorporates suggestions by the president, general counsel, vice president for business and planning, assistant vice president for human resources and director for equal opportunity services.
Equal employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top management leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer responsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This responsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department heads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO/AA as a critical component of university operations.
Responsibility
The broad-based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal employment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non-discrimination and affirmative action are everyone's responsibility.
In support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity commitments, the Office of Human Resources has been charged with responsibility for coordination of the university's EEO/AA programs, which includes: developing and implementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the attention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans and monitoring and reporting results; and handling or referring complaints to appropriate university access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external organizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action issues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, as well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA).
Other individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO/AA include:

The U.S. Department of Labor, including the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) is responsible for the external administration and enforcement of the applicable federal laws, rules and regulations cited in this policy.
Accountability
This policy was developed by Equal Opportunity Services and incorporates suggestions by the president, general counsel, vice president for business and planning, assistant vice president for human resources and director for equal opportunity services.
Equal employment opportunity and affirmative action must be supported by top management leadership to succeed. The president of the university is the chief officer responsible for oversight of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action program. This responsibility is delegated through the provost, vice presidents, deans and department heads, who support the president in maintaining the importance of EEO/AA as a critical component of university operations.
Responsibility
The broad-based efforts of all faculty and staff are key to meeting the university's equal employment opportunity commitments. At Carnegie Mellon, non-discrimination and affirmative action are everyone's responsibility.
In support of Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action and equal employment opportunity commitments, the Office of Human Resources has been charged with responsibility for coordination of the university's EEO/AA programs, which includes: developing and implementing procedures, policies and programs and bringing new initiatives to the attention of senior administrators; formulating Carnegie Mellon's affirmative action plans and monitoring and reporting results; and handling or referring complaints to appropriate university access points. EOS maintains communication with appropriate external organizations in order to remain informed about employment and affirmative action issues. The department also coordinates accommodations for individuals with disabilities, as well as compliance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Vietnam Era Veterans’ Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA).
Other individuals and offices carrying specific responsibilities for EEO/AA include:



Farnam Jahanian, president, 412-268-2200
