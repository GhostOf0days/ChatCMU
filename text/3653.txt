Carnegie Mellon's Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Software Engineering (REUSE) program is an opportunity for undergraduate students to spend a summer working with some of the world's leading Software Engineering faculty researchers. A number of projects are available in diverse areas which may include automated bug repair, mining software repositories, green computing, requirements engineering, program analysis, programming languages, and usable programming tools. Accepted students will work closely with CMU faculty and researchers on research problems with the potential for publication and significant impact on the future practice of software engineering.Some of our past REUSE students have gone on to join top Ph.D. programs in computer science such as those at CMU, Berkeley, and the University of Washington; have published papers in major conferences; have won NSF graduate research fellowships; and have placed in the CRA's Outstanding Undergraduate award and ACM's student research competitions. We are excited to see what you can do!Special Note: We are especially interested in promoting research opportunities for students traditionally underrepresented in computer science, and for first- and second-year undergraduate students. Neither research experience nor advanced coursework in computer science or software engineering is required.You are eligible if you meet all of the following criteria:Unfortunately high school students and foreign nationals studying at non-U.S. institutions are not eligible for REUSE.  If you are on a student visa and you are accepted to REUSE, you will need to apply for CPT or OPT at your home institution before the program starts.Support the REUSE ProgramThe application for the summer 2023 program is now closed.

We are excited to see what you can do!
Special Note: We are especially interested in promoting research opportunities for students traditionally underrepresented in computer science, and for first- and second-year undergraduate students. Neither research experience nor advanced coursework in computer science or software engineering is required.

What will you get?

                We understand that you have many options for how to spend your summer — not the least of which is earning money through a summer job! We don't want you to miss out on that in order to participate in the program!So, as a part of your REUSE package you will not only gain significant experience in rigorous research from a top-tier university, but you'll also be afforded a $6,000 stipend and $1,400 meal allowance! We also provide housing in air-condition campus housing and pay for your travel to and from Pittsburgh at the beginning and end of the summer.
