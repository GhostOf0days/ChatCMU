I was successful in making him laugh with my impatience to gobble up a piece of cake from his hand, instead of posing for a memorable picture.My mom is the best cook in the world. No, seriously you have no idea how great my mom is. I am from Hyderabad and I love even the simplest of her rasams more compared to the famous Hyderabadi biryani. She is my friend and also the epitome of patience.One of my favourite relationships is being and having a sister. Its the whole package, really -  support each other, pull each others' legs, conversing on philosophies of life, cooking, sharing, everything!.Be it a Saturday or a Sunday, he is always there for you! I love how our own Dumbledore of LTI is witty, wise and sarcastic. There is a lot to learn from your dedication and calm nature. Of course I am not qualified enough to brag about your research capabilities here. Ranging from throught process of how to choose an interesting problem to doing systematic groundwork to pushing boundaries, I am making a novice apprentice effort in learning all this from you.Just like all kids, I have grown up watching Road Runner, Tom and Jerry and Flinstones. Apart from these, the only other reality shows I have watched are dance competitions. Not having a dance teacher close to my home as a kid did not give the opportunity to be trained in dance and I know that's not an excuse. That did not stop me from learning random dance compositions from my seniors in undergrad and performing. Now and then, I still go through numerous free online lessons to learn traditional dance. The feeling you get after learning a sequence of steps and what they mean is amazing. I know I should be more systematic and sincere in learning this art form...Well, its raining and my meeting got cancelled. Though the rain had nothing to do with the cancellation, I decided to stay back home. My brain says do something else and I opened YouTube with a movie suggestion. I know my amateur drawing does not resemble her but she happens to be Deepika Padukone.Sunday evening chit chats with a friend who did not know the story of Pride and Prejudice... While giving a gist of the story, I wanted to read it again myself. Juggling between other activities, I managed to finish it after around 3 days and then I am in the mood to sketch it along with an awesome remark. Misaligning dialog of Mr Darcy with the frame in the drawing I managed to get make a small sketch.I will let you in on a small secret. This is where I am going to admit that I started drawing a face and smudged the corners. Darkening it more and adding a theme turned out to be this. That is not it. When some of my friends saw this, they told me that they love Sachin Tendulkar. Well, who doesn't? But that's not the point. I have not tried to draw him. Turned out to be a happy accident.The first time I had to stay away from my home is for my undergraduation. I should not call myself a hostelite as my home was just 12kms away and I would go away to eat my mom's food and sleep in my bed every weekend. Although I still qualify as a psuedo-hostelite since I spent 5 and a half days a week in hostel. These people are my family there. I leanred the power of adjustments, understanding each other and helping each other out. The numerous night outs with both academic stuff and of course random chattering and campus walks discussing topics ranging from the life of a tadpole to deep philosophies of existence are amazing only because of you guys. Complimenting all this is the midnight juice we get from our canteen where I have no idea of the frantic number of chocolate milkshakes that made all this even more blissful.The term is derived from the Sanskrit name for Lord Krishna. It means 'One who is as clear as a crystal'. I am fascinated by the phonetics of the word. I have heard someone talk about this name in a temple. It also means that babies have no prejudices or hatred. Their personalities reflect from what is written on their crystal clear hearts and minds. It may be true that a soul strengthens by learning from adversities. But that need not be the case always. We are capable of learning through empathy. Placing ourselves in the shoes of another person comes naturally to us. Understanding, respecting and being welcoming of people around us strengthens us and our community that fills our clean canvas we get as babies with a beautiful painting.One of the early drawings I made was to gift a friend. There is no occasion but I know she loves Federer. She knows a lot of technical details of the sport which I learn from discussing with her. I am one of those who like decorating their rooms with personalized stuff that reminds us of a story. I wanted her room also to have a small amateur piece of sketch of the person she adores.

Arts and Sports
In my spare time...







DADDY
Since even before I could stroll, he made my support system impregnable and a whole!
I was successful in making him laugh with my impatience to gobble up a piece of cake from his hand, instead of posing for a memorable picture.








AMMA
My mom is the best cook in the world. No, seriously you have no idea how great my mom is. I am from Hyderabad and I love even the simplest of her rasams more compared to the famous Hyderabadi biryani. She is my friend and also the epitome of patience.







ANNA & ELSA
One of my favourite relationships is being and having a sister. Its the whole package, really -  support each other, pull each others' legs, conversing on philosophies of life, cooking, sharing, everything!.








THAT'S MY ADVISOR ALAN BLACK
Be it a Saturday or a Sunday, he is always there for you! I love how our own Dumbledore of LTI is witty, wise and sarcastic. There is a lot to learn from your dedication and calm nature. Of course I am not qualified enough to brag about your research capabilities here. Ranging from throught process of how to choose an interesting problem to doing systematic groundwork to pushing boundaries, I am making a novice apprentice effort in learning all this from you.








DANCE...
Just like all kids, I have grown up watching Road Runner, Tom and Jerry and Flinstones. Apart from these, the only other reality shows I have watched are dance competitions. Not having a dance teacher close to my home as a kid did not give the opportunity to be trained in dance and I know that's not an excuse. That did not stop me from learning random dance compositions from my seniors in undergrad and performing. Now and then, I still go through numerous free online lessons to learn traditional dance. The feeling you get after learning a sequence of steps and what they mean is amazing. I know I should be more systematic and sincere in learning this art form...








WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MEETING IS CANCELLED...
Well, its raining and my meeting got cancelled. Though the rain had nothing to do with the cancellation, I decided to stay back home. My brain says do something else and I opened YouTube with a movie suggestion. I know my amateur drawing does not resemble her but she happens to be Deepika Padukone.








PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
Sunday evening chit chats with a friend who did not know the story of Pride and Prejudice... While giving a gist of the story, I wanted to read it again myself. Juggling between other activities, I managed to finish it after around 3 days and then I am in the mood to sketch it along with an awesome remark. Misaligning dialog of Mr Darcy with the frame in the drawing I managed to get make a small sketch.








A HAPPY ACCIDENT :)
I will let you in on a small secret. This is where I am going to admit that I started drawing a face and smudged the corners. Darkening it more and adding a theme turned out to be this. That is not it. When some of my friends saw this, they told me that they love Sachin Tendulkar. Well, who doesn't? But that's not the point. I have not tried to draw him. Turned out to be a happy accident.








MEET MY FRIENDS :)
The first time I had to stay away from my home is for my undergraduation. I should not call myself a hostelite as my home was just 12kms away and I would go away to eat my mom's food and sleep in my bed every weekend. Although I still qualify as a psuedo-hostelite since I spent 5 and a half days a week in hostel. These people are my family there. I leanred the power of adjustments, understanding each other and helping each other out. The numerous night outs with both academic stuff and of course random chattering and campus walks discussing topics ranging from the life of a tadpole to deep philosophies of existence are amazing only because of you guys. Complimenting all this is the midnight juice we get from our canteen where I have no idea of the frantic number of chocolate milkshakes that made all this even more blissful.








AVYUKTA
The term is derived from the Sanskrit name for Lord Krishna. It means 'One who is as clear as a crystal'. I am fascinated by the phonetics of the word. I have heard someone talk about this name in a temple. It also means that babies have no prejudices or hatred. Their personalities reflect from what is written on their crystal clear hearts and minds. It may be true that a soul strengthens by learning from adversities. But that need not be the case always. We are capable of learning through empathy. Placing ourselves in the shoes of another person comes naturally to us. Understanding, respecting and being welcoming of people around us strengthens us and our community that fills our clean canvas we get as babies with a beautiful painting.








FEDERER AND NADAL
One of the early drawings I made was to gift a friend. There is no occasion but I know she loves Federer. She knows a lot of technical details of the sport which I learn from discussing with her. I am one of those who like decorating their rooms with personalized stuff that reminds us of a story. I wanted her room also to have a small amateur piece of sketch of the person she adores. Hence it all began ...

In my spare time...







DADDY
Since even before I could stroll, he made my support system impregnable and a whole!
I was successful in making him laugh with my impatience to gobble up a piece of cake from his hand, instead of posing for a memorable picture.








AMMA
My mom is the best cook in the world. No, seriously you have no idea how great my mom is. I am from Hyderabad and I love even the simplest of her rasams more compared to the famous Hyderabadi biryani. She is my friend and also the epitome of patience.







ANNA & ELSA
One of my favourite relationships is being and having a sister. Its the whole package, really -  support each other, pull each others' legs, conversing on philosophies of life, cooking, sharing, everything!.








THAT'S MY ADVISOR ALAN BLACK
Be it a Saturday or a Sunday, he is always there for you! I love how our own Dumbledore of LTI is witty, wise and sarcastic. There is a lot to learn from your dedication and calm nature. Of course I am not qualified enough to brag about your research capabilities here. Ranging from throught process of how to choose an interesting problem to doing systematic groundwork to pushing boundaries, I am making a novice apprentice effort in learning all this from you.








DANCE...
Just like all kids, I have grown up watching Road Runner, Tom and Jerry and Flinstones. Apart from these, the only other reality shows I have watched are dance competitions. Not having a dance teacher close to my home as a kid did not give the opportunity to be trained in dance and I know that's not an excuse. That did not stop me from learning random dance compositions from my seniors in undergrad and performing. Now and then, I still go through numerous free online lessons to learn traditional dance. The feeling you get after learning a sequence of steps and what they mean is amazing. I know I should be more systematic and sincere in learning this art form...








WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MEETING IS CANCELLED...
Well, its raining and my meeting got cancelled. Though the rain had nothing to do with the cancellation, I decided to stay back home. My brain says do something else and I opened YouTube with a movie suggestion. I know my amateur drawing does not resemble her but she happens to be Deepika Padukone.








PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
Sunday evening chit chats with a friend who did not know the story of Pride and Prejudice... While giving a gist of the story, I wanted to read it again myself. Juggling between other activities, I managed to finish it after around 3 days and then I am in the mood to sketch it along with an awesome remark. Misaligning dialog of Mr Darcy with the frame in the drawing I managed to get make a small sketch.








A HAPPY ACCIDENT :)
I will let you in on a small secret. This is where I am going to admit that I started drawing a face and smudged the corners. Darkening it more and adding a theme turned out to be this. That is not it. When some of my friends saw this, they told me that they love Sachin Tendulkar. Well, who doesn't? But that's not the point. I have not tried to draw him. Turned out to be a happy accident.








MEET MY FRIENDS :)
The first time I had to stay away from my home is for my undergraduation. I should not call myself a hostelite as my home was just 12kms away and I would go away to eat my mom's food and sleep in my bed every weekend. Although I still qualify as a psuedo-hostelite since I spent 5 and a half days a week in hostel. These people are my family there. I leanred the power of adjustments, understanding each other and helping each other out. The numerous night outs with both academic stuff and of course random chattering and campus walks discussing topics ranging from the life of a tadpole to deep philosophies of existence are amazing only because of you guys. Complimenting all this is the midnight juice we get from our canteen where I have no idea of the frantic number of chocolate milkshakes that made all this even more blissful.








AVYUKTA
The term is derived from the Sanskrit name for Lord Krishna. It means 'One who is as clear as a crystal'. I am fascinated by the phonetics of the word. I have heard someone talk about this name in a temple. It also means that babies have no prejudices or hatred. Their personalities reflect from what is written on their crystal clear hearts and minds. It may be true that a soul strengthens by learning from adversities. But that need not be the case always. We are capable of learning through empathy. Placing ourselves in the shoes of another person comes naturally to us. Understanding, respecting and being welcoming of people around us strengthens us and our community that fills our clean canvas we get as babies with a beautiful painting.








FEDERER AND NADAL
One of the early drawings I made was to gift a friend. There is no occasion but I know she loves Federer. She knows a lot of technical details of the sport which I learn from discussing with her. I am one of those who like decorating their rooms with personalized stuff that reminds us of a story. I wanted her room also to have a small amateur piece of sketch of the person she adores. Hence it all began ...

Hey, I'm Khyathi Chandu!
 I am a PhD candidate in   Language Technologies Institute   at   Carnegie Mellon University . I am fortunate to be advised by our very own Dumbledore for NLP,   Prof. Alan Black  . I also work(ed) with   Yonatan Bisk  ,   Prof. Eric Nyberg   and   Louis-Philippe Morency  . I am currently working with Yonatan Bisk and Alan Black on laying a ground work towards building  conversations in augmented/virtual reality. Simultaneously, I am also working towards improving structure in long form generation. 
The overarching goal of my research is to enable seamless interaction between intelligent machines and humans. Facilitating multimodal communication is an essential component of this. To this end, I work on controllable language generation with vision and language as input, focussing on content, structure and personality of generated text. I also work on long form generation, like stories and procedures.
Towards realizing this, I am working on  "Effective Controllability of Multimodal Narrative Intelligence"  for my thesis. 
During my PhD, I spent 2 wonderful summers interning at  Google Research  and  Apple ; and another 2 summers exploring the breadths and depths of NLP.

Being a multilingual myself, I appreciate how code-switching between languages made my communication and expressiveness easier. I worked on sequence-labelling, question answering and sequence generation tasks for code-switching. I have also   led our winning team in the BioASQ challenge   in 2018.
Prior to joining CMU, I completed my under-graduation from IIIT-Hyderabad, India. During this time, I am humbled to be selected as an   S.N.Bose Scholar   to visit University of Pennsylvania as a research intern.

Being a multilingual myself, I appreciate how code-switching between languages made my communication and expressiveness easier. I worked on sequence-labelling, question answering and sequence generation tasks for code-switching. I have also   led our winning team in the BioASQ challenge   in 2018.
Prior to joining CMU, I completed my under-graduation from IIIT-Hyderabad, India. During this time, I am humbled to be selected as an   S.N.Bose Scholar   to visit University of Pennsylvania as a research intern.

Hey, I'm Khyathi Chandu!
 I am a PhD candidate in   Language Technologies Institute   at   Carnegie Mellon University . I am fortunate to be advised by our very own Dumbledore for NLP,   Prof. Alan Black  . I also work(ed) with   Yonatan Bisk  ,   Prof. Eric Nyberg   and   Louis-Philippe Morency  . I am currently working with Yonatan Bisk and Alan Black on laying a ground work towards building  conversations in augmented/virtual reality. Simultaneously, I am also working towards improving structure in long form generation. 
The overarching goal of my research is to enable seamless interaction between intelligent machines and humans. Facilitating multimodal communication is an essential component of this. To this end, I work on controllable language generation with vision and language as input, focussing on content, structure and personality of generated text. I also work on long form generation, like stories and procedures.

Arts and Sports
In my spare time...







DADDY
Since even before I could stroll, he made my support system impregnable and a whole!
I was successful in making him laugh with my impatience to gobble up a piece of cake from his hand, instead of posing for a memorable picture.








AMMA
My mom is the best cook in the world. No, seriously you have no idea how great my mom is. I am from Hyderabad and I love even the simplest of her rasams more compared to the famous Hyderabadi biryani. She is my friend and also the epitome of patience.







ANNA & ELSA
One of my favourite relationships is being and having a sister. Its the whole package, really -  support each other, pull each others' legs, conversing on philosophies of life, cooking, sharing, everything!.








THAT'S MY ADVISOR ALAN BLACK
Be it a Saturday or a Sunday, he is always there for you! I love how our own Dumbledore of LTI is witty, wise and sarcastic. There is a lot to learn from your dedication and calm nature. Of course I am not qualified enough to brag about your research capabilities here. Ranging from throught process of how to choose an interesting problem to doing systematic groundwork to pushing boundaries, I am making a novice apprentice effort in learning all this from you.








DANCE...
Just like all kids, I have grown up watching Road Runner, Tom and Jerry and Flinstones. Apart from these, the only other reality shows I have watched are dance competitions. Not having a dance teacher close to my home as a kid did not give the opportunity to be trained in dance and I know that's not an excuse. That did not stop me from learning random dance compositions from my seniors in undergrad and performing. Now and then, I still go through numerous free online lessons to learn traditional dance. The feeling you get after learning a sequence of steps and what they mean is amazing. I know I should be more systematic and sincere in learning this art form...








WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MEETING IS CANCELLED...
Well, its raining and my meeting got cancelled. Though the rain had nothing to do with the cancellation, I decided to stay back home. My brain says do something else and I opened YouTube with a movie suggestion. I know my amateur drawing does not resemble her but she happens to be Deepika Padukone.








PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
Sunday evening chit chats with a friend who did not know the story of Pride and Prejudice... While giving a gist of the story, I wanted to read it again myself. Juggling between other activities, I managed to finish it after around 3 days and then I am in the mood to sketch it along with an awesome remark. Misaligning dialog of Mr Darcy with the frame in the drawing I managed to get make a small sketch.








A HAPPY ACCIDENT :)
I will let you in on a small secret. This is where I am going to admit that I started drawing a face and smudged the corners. Darkening it more and adding a theme turned out to be this. That is not it. When some of my friends saw this, they told me that they love Sachin Tendulkar. Well, who doesn't? But that's not the point. I have not tried to draw him. Turned out to be a happy accident.








MEET MY FRIENDS :)
The first time I had to stay away from my home is for my undergraduation. I should not call myself a hostelite as my home was just 12kms away and I would go away to eat my mom's food and sleep in my bed every weekend. Although I still qualify as a psuedo-hostelite since I spent 5 and a half days a week in hostel. These people are my family there. I leanred the power of adjustments, understanding each other and helping each other out. The numerous night outs with both academic stuff and of course random chattering and campus walks discussing topics ranging from the life of a tadpole to deep philosophies of existence are amazing only because of you guys. Complimenting all this is the midnight juice we get from our canteen where I have no idea of the frantic number of chocolate milkshakes that made all this even more blissful.








AVYUKTA
The term is derived from the Sanskrit name for Lord Krishna. It means 'One who is as clear as a crystal'. I am fascinated by the phonetics of the word. I have heard someone talk about this name in a temple. It also means that babies have no prejudices or hatred. Their personalities reflect from what is written on their crystal clear hearts and minds. It may be true that a soul strengthens by learning from adversities. But that need not be the case always. We are capable of learning through empathy. Placing ourselves in the shoes of another person comes naturally to us. Understanding, respecting and being welcoming of people around us strengthens us and our community that fills our clean canvas we get as babies with a beautiful painting.








FEDERER AND NADAL
One of the early drawings I made was to gift a friend. There is no occasion but I know she loves Federer. She knows a lot of technical details of the sport which I learn from discussing with her. I am one of those who like decorating their rooms with personalized stuff that reminds us of a story. I wanted her room also to have a small amateur piece of sketch of the person she adores. Hence it all began ...
