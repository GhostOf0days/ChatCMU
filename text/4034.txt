Science and Humanities Scholars Program





 
Science and Humanities Scholars
After careful consideration, the university has decided to phase out the Science and Humanities Scholars (SHS) program. The first-year class that began at Carnegie Mellon in 2018 will be the last class to participate in the program and we will no longer be inviting new students to participate in the program. 
Students who joined the program in 2018 or earlier will still have access to the educational and advising opportunities that are hallmarks of the program through their graduation. They can follow the SHS curriculum that appears on this site through their graduation.
