Because of our global diversity, Carnegie Mellon understands from the "inside out" even as it provides opportunities and experiences from the "outside in" what it means to be a global university, and the importance of working together by learning to listen, to communicate, and to understand and respect one another, and one another's cultures.  To assist you from the time you consider applying to Carnegie Mellon until you become one of our alumni, we have resources specifically for our international students.
