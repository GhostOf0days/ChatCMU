Bio
Pingbo Tang, Ph.D., is an associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He founded and is directing Spatiotemporal Workflows and Resilient Management Laboratory (SWARM Lab). He obtained his Bachelor’s Degree in Civil Engineering in 2002, and his Master’s Degree in Bridge Engineering in 2005, both from Tongji University, Shanghai, China. He obtained his Ph.D. from the group of Advanced Infrastructure Systems (AIS) at Carnegie Mellon University in 2009.
Tang is an expert on civil infrastructure operations and human systems engineering for civil infrastructure operational safety. His research explores remote sensing, human systems engineering, and information modeling technology in support of the spatiotemporal analyses needed for the effective management of workspaces, constructed facilities, and civil infrastructure systems. His ongoing studies have been examining sensing and modeling methods for comprehending the Human-Cyber-Physical-Systems (H-CPS) in accelerated construction and infrastructure operations (e.g., airport operations, power plant operations, water treatment plant control). He has published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles in these areas. The National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the industry have funded his research efforts.
Tang holds memberships or leadership positions of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE, the Vice-Chair of the Computing Division Executive Committee), TRB (Committee on Bridge Management, AHD35), and ASTM International (Committee E57: 3D imaging systems). He is serving on the editorial boards of multiple journals (e.g., ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering), and as a reviewer of multiple top journals and conferences related to Computing in Civil Engineering. He won best paper awards at top conferences (e.g., the 2019 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering), the 2013 Recent Alumnus Achievement Award of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Daniel W. Halpin Award for Scholarship in Construction from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2020. Tang won the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2015.

Bio
Pingbo Tang, Ph.D., is an associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He founded and is directing Spatiotemporal Workflows and Resilient Management Laboratory (SWARM Lab). He obtained his Bachelor’s Degree in Civil Engineering in 2002, and his Master’s Degree in Bridge Engineering in 2005, both from Tongji University, Shanghai, China. He obtained his Ph.D. from the group of Advanced Infrastructure Systems (AIS) at Carnegie Mellon University in 2009.
Tang is an expert on civil infrastructure operations and human systems engineering for civil infrastructure operational safety. His research explores remote sensing, human systems engineering, and information modeling technology in support of the spatiotemporal analyses needed for the effective management of workspaces, constructed facilities, and civil infrastructure systems. His ongoing studies have been examining sensing and modeling methods for comprehending the Human-Cyber-Physical-Systems (H-CPS) in accelerated construction and infrastructure operations (e.g., airport operations, power plant operations, water treatment plant control). He has published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles in these areas. The National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the industry have funded his research efforts.
Tang holds memberships or leadership positions of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE, the Vice-Chair of the Computing Division Executive Committee), TRB (Committee on Bridge Management, AHD35), and ASTM International (Committee E57: 3D imaging systems). He is serving on the editorial boards of multiple journals (e.g., ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering), and as a reviewer of multiple top journals and conferences related to Computing in Civil Engineering. He won best paper awards at top conferences (e.g., the 2019 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering), the 2013 Recent Alumnus Achievement Award of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Daniel W. Halpin Award for Scholarship in Construction from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2020. Tang won the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2015.

Bio
Pingbo Tang, Ph.D., is an associate professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. He founded and is directing Spatiotemporal Workflows and Resilient Management Laboratory (SWARM Lab). He obtained his Bachelor’s Degree in Civil Engineering in 2002, and his Master’s Degree in Bridge Engineering in 2005, both from Tongji University, Shanghai, China. He obtained his Ph.D. from the group of Advanced Infrastructure Systems (AIS) at Carnegie Mellon University in 2009.
Tang is an expert on civil infrastructure operations and human systems engineering for civil infrastructure operational safety. His research explores remote sensing, human systems engineering, and information modeling technology in support of the spatiotemporal analyses needed for the effective management of workspaces, constructed facilities, and civil infrastructure systems. His ongoing studies have been examining sensing and modeling methods for comprehending the Human-Cyber-Physical-Systems (H-CPS) in accelerated construction and infrastructure operations (e.g., airport operations, power plant operations, water treatment plant control). He has published more than 100 peer-reviewed articles in these areas. The National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the industry have funded his research efforts.
Tang holds memberships or leadership positions of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE, the Vice-Chair of the Computing Division Executive Committee), TRB (Committee on Bridge Management, AHD35), and ASTM International (Committee E57: 3D imaging systems). He is serving on the editorial boards of multiple journals (e.g., ASCE Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering), and as a reviewer of multiple top journals and conferences related to Computing in Civil Engineering. He won best paper awards at top conferences (e.g., the 2019 ASCE International Conference on Computing in Civil Engineering), the 2013 Recent Alumnus Achievement Award of the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University, and the Daniel W. Halpin Award for Scholarship in Construction from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2020. Tang won the National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2015.
