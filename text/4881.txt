The Uniform Guidance (UG) simplifies and supersedes guidance that was previously contained in eight different OMB Circulars, including A-110, A-21, and A-133. Contained within the UG are new definitions, uniform administrative requirements for pre-award and post-award, cost principles, and audit requirements. Federal agencies are currently developing their implementation plans under this guidance and these new regulations will become effective on December 26, 2014.

Federal Regulations: On December 26, 2013, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). The Uniform Guidance (UG) simplifies and supersedes guidance that was previously contained in eight different OMB Circulars, including A-110, A-21, and A-133. Contained within the UG are new definitions, uniform administrative requirements for pre-award and post-award, cost principles, and audit requirements. Federal agencies are currently developing their implementation plans under this guidance and these new regulations will become effective on December 26, 2014.
