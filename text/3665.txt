Alumni from around the world form volunteer networks with other Tartans, current students and parents to build and maintain connections with each other and with CMU. Regardless of where you live, what you do and how you play, you can tap into one or more of these volunteer-led programming areas or help start one.CMU's volunteers and networks are integral to creating connections with each other and to the university. In recognition of these dedicated volunteers' great work, the Alumni Association Board established the Network of the Year Award. This annual award recognizes up to three networks (small, medium and large), selected by the AAB Awards Committee, for their successful efforts throughout the year. Winning networks each receive $500.If you don't see your location, interest or student organization affiliation, fill out the Volunteer Interest Form, and the Alumni Association will be in touch!Carnegie Mellon University alumni networks are open to all alumni, regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.ONLINE EVENTSCampus EventsACADEMIC PROGRAMMINGUpdate Your InformationGive Now

 Access the Tartan Network
Alumni from around the world form volunteer networks with other Tartans, current students and parents to build and maintain connections with each other and with CMU. Regardless of where you live, what you do and how you play, you can tap into one or more of these volunteer-led programming areas or help start one.
CMU's volunteers and networks are integral to creating connections with each other and to the university. In recognition of these dedicated volunteers' great work, the Alumni Association Board established the Network of the Year Award. This annual award recognizes up to three networks (small, medium and large), selected by the AAB Awards Committee, for their successful efforts throughout the year. Winning networks each receive $500.
If you don't see your location, interest or student organization affiliation, fill out the Volunteer Interest Form, and the Alumni Association will be in touch!

Carnegie Mellon University alumni networks are open to all alumni, regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.

 Access the Tartan Network
Alumni from around the world form volunteer networks with other Tartans, current students and parents to build and maintain connections with each other and with CMU. Regardless of where you live, what you do and how you play, you can tap into one or more of these volunteer-led programming areas or help start one.
CMU's volunteers and networks are integral to creating connections with each other and to the university. In recognition of these dedicated volunteers' great work, the Alumni Association Board established the Network of the Year Award. This annual award recognizes up to three networks (small, medium and large), selected by the AAB Awards Committee, for their successful efforts throughout the year. Winning networks each receive $500.
If you don't see your location, interest or student organization affiliation, fill out the Volunteer Interest Form, and the Alumni Association will be in touch!

Carnegie Mellon University alumni networks are open to all alumni, regardless of race, color, national origin, sex, handicap or disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information.
