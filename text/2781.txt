				I am an associate professor at CMU in the Machine Learning and the Computer Science departments. I work in the areas of machine learning, statistics, information theory and game theory. My current work addresses various biases and other challenges in human evaluations via principled and practical approaches. A focus application is scientific peer review, where our work has already made significant impact.

		My research focusses on two inter-related themes:
		
 Distributed human evaluations: 
Distributed human evaluations are integral to various applications where a set of items is assessed by a group of individuals, each person evaluating only a subset of the items and each item being evaluated by only a handful of individuals. This setup is commonly seen in domains such as scientific peer review, hiring and promotion processes, academic admissions, crowdsourcing initiatives, healthcare assessments, judicial verdicts, and online rating and recommendation systems, among others. The decentralization of evaluations, however, often leads to a host of challenges including instances of fraud, subjectivity, miscalibration, biases, breaches of privacy, and operational inefficiencies.


		
		 Research on research Our research also focuses on problems in scientific research itself and its evaluations. The challenges within this domain hold substantial consequences. They impact the allocation of billions of dollars in annual grant awards, influence the trajectories of researchers' careers due to the "rich-gets-richer" phenomenon in academia, and can detrimentally affect the public's perception of science. 
		
		Our research addresses these important challenges at scale, in a principled and pragmatic manner. Our work  is comprehensive, establishing fundamental limits, designing algorithms, deriving theoretical guaranees for them, conducting evaluations, and working with users for actual deployment and impact. The algorithms we have developed are now extensively used for peer review of tens of thousands of papers across computer science and various other fields. Additionally, our experiments have helped to shape the policies of numerous peer-review venues in an evidence-based manner. Finally, the impact of our work extends to domains beyond review of scientific papers.

				I am an associate professor at CMU in the Machine Learning and the Computer Science departments. I work in the areas of machine learning, statistics, information theory and game theory. My current work addresses various biases and other challenges in human evaluations via principled and practical approaches. A focus application is scientific peer review, where our work has already made significant impact.

 RESEARCH 

		My research focusses on two inter-related themes:
		
 Distributed human evaluations: 
Distributed human evaluations are integral to various applications where a set of items is assessed by a group of individuals, each person evaluating only a subset of the items and each item being evaluated by only a handful of individuals. This setup is commonly seen in domains such as scientific peer review, hiring and promotion processes, academic admissions, crowdsourcing initiatives, healthcare assessments, judicial verdicts, and online rating and recommendation systems, among others. The decentralization of evaluations, however, often leads to a host of challenges including instances of fraud, subjectivity, miscalibration, biases, breaches of privacy, and operational inefficiencies.


		
		 Research on research Our research also focuses on problems in scientific research itself and its evaluations. The challenges within this domain hold substantial consequences. They impact the allocation of billions of dollars in annual grant awards, influence the trajectories of researchers' careers due to the "rich-gets-richer" phenomenon in academia, and can detrimentally affect the public's perception of science. 
		
		Our research addresses these important challenges at scale, in a principled and pragmatic manner. Our work  is comprehensive, establishing fundamental limits, designing algorithms, deriving theoretical guaranees for them, conducting evaluations, and working with users for actual deployment and impact. The algorithms we have developed are now extensively used for peer review of tens of thousands of papers across computer science and various other fields. Additionally, our experiments have helped to shape the policies of numerous peer-review venues in an evidence-based manner. Finally, the impact of our work extends to domains beyond review of scientific papers.

				I am an associate professor at CMU in the Machine Learning and the Computer Science departments. I work in the areas of machine learning, statistics, information theory and game theory. My current work addresses various biases and other challenges in human evaluations via principled and practical approaches. A focus application is scientific peer review, where our work has already made significant impact.
