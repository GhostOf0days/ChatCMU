 The Dietrich College General Education program encompasses a set of requirements that provide a core foundation and knowledge for all students across the College, regardless of their primary major.
In the Fall of 2021, we launched a new General Education program that will be required for all students entering in Fall 2021 and beyond.
Fall 2021 and Beyond
Students who started in Dietrich College prior to Fall 2021 will continue to follow the previous General Education curriculum.
