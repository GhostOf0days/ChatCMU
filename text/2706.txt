The Master of Science in Robotics (MSR) program brings together areas of robotics research that would otherwise be spread across different departments or separate universities. It focuses on preparing students to take a leading role in the research and development of future generations of integrated robotics technologies and systems.Requirements for the degree include course work, four core courses and three electives, and research that results in a thesis document and a public talk. The MSR program is designed to mimic the first two years of a PhD program to allow students interested in a PhD to gather experience and have an easy transition.
Students typically complete the program in two full academic years, graduating in August of their second summer. Throughout the program, students split their time between research and course work.

Students are involved in every aspect of research – from initial problem formulation to the final publication of results.Research is conducted in the laboratories of the Robotics Institute under the supervision of faculty advisers and in collaboration with student colleagues.

With support from their research advisor and their MSR Thesis Committee, MSR students write a thesis document and host a public thesis talk.The MSR program is a doorway to a research career, preparing the candidate well for doctoral degree programs as well as research staff positions at companies and government agencies such as NASA, Mitsubishi and Google. The degree emphasizes course and research qualifications equally, ensuring that the student attains both breadth of understanding in Robotics together with specialized depth knowledge in an area of particular interest to the student and faculty advisor. Depth areas are entirely customized to student and faculty joint interests, including for instance Human-Robot Interaction, Haptics, Field Robotics, Robotic Vision, Machine Learning, et cetera.
