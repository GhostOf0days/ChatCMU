Pittsburgh, PA 15213                I am an Assistant Professor in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I lead the Zoom Lab. I’m interested in bio-inspired solutions to increase mechanical intelligence in robots and robotic components.Current robots are primarily rigid machines that exist in highly constrained or open environments such as factory floors, warehouses, or fields. There is an increasing demand for more adaptable, mobile, and flexible robots that can manipulate or move through complex environments. This problem is currently being addressed in two complementary ways: (i) learning and control algorithms to enable the robot to better sense and adapt to the surrounding environment and (ii) embedded intelligence in mechanical structures. My vision is to create robots that can mechanically conform to the environment or objects that they interact with to alleviate the need for high-speed, high-accuracy, and high-precision controllers. I pursue this goal by developing compliant mechanisms for manipulators and robots, teaching classes focusing on bio-inspiration and unconventional robotics, and engaging with the community to increase interest in science and engineering.ABOUTDiversity, Equity and InclusionHiring Faculty PositionsHistory of the Robotics InstituteMaps, Directions & ParkingRI Branding & IdentityDiversity, Equity and InclusionHiring Faculty PositionsHistory of the Robotics InstituteMaps, Directions & ParkingRI Branding & IdentityPEOPLEAllFacultySpecial FacultyPostdocsStaffInstitute StaffProject StaffStudentsPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesVisitorsAdjunct Faculty and AffiliatesAlumniAllFacultySpecial FacultyPostdocsStaffInstitute StaffProject StaffInstitute StaffProject StaffStudentsPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesVisitorsAdjunct Faculty and AffiliatesAlumniRESEARCHResearchPublicationsCentersLabs & GroupsProjectsRobotsResearchPublicationsCentersLabs & GroupsProjectsRobotsEDUCATIONAcademic ProgramsBachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)CoursesCMU Student ServicesRI Student LifeRI Summer ScholarsAcademic ProgramsBachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)Bachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramAdditional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)CoursesCMU Student ServicesRI Student LifeRI Summer ScholarsNEWSVideosVideosEVENTSAll EventsSeminarsStudent TalksSpecial EventsFaculty EventsStaff EventsRobotics Institute Seminar VideosAll EventsSeminarsStudent TalksSpecial EventsFaculty EventsStaff EventsRobotics Institute Seminar VideosNREC

I am an Assistant Professor in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I lead the Zoom Lab. I’m interested in bio-inspired solutions to increase mechanical intelligence in robots and robotic components.
Current robots are primarily rigid machines that exist in highly constrained or open environments such as factory floors, warehouses, or fields. There is an increasing demand for more adaptable, mobile, and flexible robots that can manipulate or move through complex environments. This problem is currently being addressed in two complementary ways: (i) learning and control algorithms to enable the robot to better sense and adapt to the surrounding environment and (ii) embedded intelligence in mechanical structures.

I am an Assistant Professor in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I lead the Zoom Lab. I’m interested in bio-inspired solutions to increase mechanical intelligence in robots and robotic components.
Current robots are primarily rigid machines that exist in highly constrained or open environments such as factory floors, warehouses, or fields. There is an increasing demand for more adaptable, mobile, and flexible robots that can manipulate or move through complex environments. This problem is currently being addressed in two complementary ways: (i) learning and control algorithms to enable the robot to better sense and adapt to the surrounding environment and (ii) embedded intelligence in mechanical structures. My vision is to create robots that can mechanically conform to the environment or objects that they interact with to alleviate the need for high-speed, high-accuracy, and high-precision controllers. I pursue this goal by developing compliant mechanisms for manipulators and robots, teaching classes focusing on bio-inspiration and unconventional robotics, and engaging with the community to increase interest in science and engineering.

I am an Assistant Professor in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, where I lead the Zoom Lab. I’m interested in bio-inspired solutions to increase mechanical intelligence in robots and robotic components.
Current robots are primarily rigid machines that exist in highly constrained or open environments such as factory floors, warehouses, or fields. There is an increasing demand for more adaptable, mobile, and flexible robots that can manipulate or move through complex environments. This problem is currently being addressed in two complementary ways: (i) learning and control algorithms to enable the robot to better sense and adapt to the surrounding environment and (ii) embedded intelligence in mechanical structures. My vision is to create robots that can mechanically conform to the environment or objects that they interact with to alleviate the need for high-speed, high-accuracy, and high-precision controllers. I pursue this goal by developing compliant mechanisms for manipulators and robots, teaching classes focusing on bio-inspiration and unconventional robotics, and engaging with the community to increase interest in science and engineering.
