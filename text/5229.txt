A virtual interactive layer model can be used to construct task based activities for these different concepts.SolutionThe layer model presents the different layers as drawers that can be opened and examined in further detail. When a layer is pulled out, it drops down at the table level. To put it back, it is pulled up to it’s initial height and it snaps back into place. This allows the users to have a more spatial understanding of the pedagogical concepts involving layers. “Opening the drawer” of a layer should allow for some extra abilities, or provide more information so that the user is motivated to open and examine each layer in greater detail.RationaleTo learn about different layered models in subject matter through a standard of how to work with an interactive layer model. Additional interactions can be added specific to subject matter. The needs of layers of the earth in archaeology could be different from those of layers of the skin in biology.

Example use cases: task-based learning about layers of the atmosphere, skin, earth, biomes etc. 










Palm Menu 



Learner Content Interaction 







ProblemIt is necessary to have quick access to a set of resources or information while performing a task with virtual objects, without cluttering the virtual space.SolutionA menu that appears when the user looks at their palms can be used in the context of performing a quick check on information, or requiring access to resources for the task at hand. This allows the information to be placed at a fixed location for all users that is generally comfortable to view, as opposed to identifying an appropriate location in 3D space which is subject to the physical space the user will be located in. If used to display information, care must be taken to avoid displaying information that needs to be viewed over sustained intervals of time, to avoid physical strain.RationaleQuick access to data and resources, similar to checking a wristwatch. 







SetClassroom desks where each student works on interactive virtual modelsSocialThe resources in each user’s palm menu can be distributed to encourage positive interdependence for a collaborative task. The teacher may have unlimited resources, and possibly a way to reset the state of the experience in this menu.EpistemicTo allow students and teachers to have access to resources and information that they can use at their discretion while performing a pedagogical task.

Gesture-based Dynamic Descriptor 



Learner Content Interaction 







ProblemThere is a need to display information about a virtual object that is hidden until prompted by the user.SolutionThe user can use a specific gesture (like pointing) to reveal more information about virtual elements. This can be used as a labelling system, to reveal short blocks of text or images. This pattern does not apply to showing large blocks of text or information that the user needs to view for a sustained time interval, due to the associated physical strain. It might be appropriate to use this gesture on specific “label” points to give the user a clearer direction for where to point.RationaleWhile the user may want more information, there is a need for some of it to be hidden so as to not overwhelm the user. It is also desirable to have a separation of interaction between revealing more information and changing the state of a virtual object. This prevents the user from accidentally changing the state of an object when trying to observe it or vice versa. 







SetClassroom desks where each student works on interactive virtual modelsSocialStudents are only able to see the descriptors in their view, and cannot see the descriptors being viewed by their peers. The teacher should be able to point out descriptors in the students view to aid in a discussion about the object.EpistemicTo hide labels until students need to see them, avoiding distractions and allowing for memorizing.

Feedback Area 



Learner Content Interaction 







ProblemThere is a need to display more information about a virtual object, in a manner that can be easily integrated into the flow of work.SolutionThe user can place virtual objects in an area that displays the desired information about them. The feedback area might be represented as, i. Pedestal – Place an object on the pedestal to view a short descriptor label that becomes visible in close vicinity to the object. ii. Dashboard – A specific receptacle to hold objects, combined with a virtual screen that can display more information like charts, graphs etc. iii. Vending Machine – Insert the virtual object into the “machine” to get objects or data as output. Users often need prompting to use the feedback area. The use of the area could be scaffolded at first and then left up to the user. Alternatively, it can be integrated into the task such that using it is a mandatory step. It may not be appropriate for use for larger virtual objects, as it might be required to move them into another area and back again.RationaleIt is necessary to view information about the state of a virtual object, perhaps for sustained periods of time. Using a gesture to do so can cause undue physical strain. This solution allows the user to move the object of interest into an area that reveals more information about its current state. In a task-based scenario, it may also be necessary for the user to repeatedly check the (changing) state of a virtual object, “submit” their work on the virtual object or check the virtual object for errors.

Interactive Layer Model 



Learner Content Interaction 







ProblemIn educational contexts, a number of concepts are described as layered models. A virtual interactive layer model can be used to construct task based activities for these different concepts.SolutionThe layer model presents the different layers as drawers that can be opened and examined in further detail. When a layer is pulled out, it drops down at the table level. To put it back, it is pulled up to it’s initial height and it snaps back into place. This allows the users to have a more spatial understanding of the pedagogical concepts involving layers. “Opening the drawer” of a layer should allow for some extra abilities, or provide more information so that the user is motivated to open and examine each layer in greater detail.RationaleTo learn about different layered models in subject matter through a standard of how to work with an interactive layer model. Additional interactions can be added specific to subject matter. The needs of layers of the earth in archaeology could be different from those of layers of the skin in biology. 







SetClassroom desks where each student works on interactive virtual modelsSocialUse of this model should be accompanied by the teacher’s scaffolding about the subject matter, and possibly a pedagogical task.EpistemicTo allow students to have a set of standard interactions with virtual layered models. 







Example use cases: task-based learning about layers of the atmosphere, skin, earth, biomes etc. 










Palm Menu 



Learner Content Interaction 







ProblemIt is necessary to have quick access to a set of resources or information while performing a task with virtual objects, without cluttering the virtual space.SolutionA menu that appears when the user looks at their palms can be used in the context of performing a quick check on information, or requiring access to resources for the task at hand. This allows the information to be placed at a fixed location for all users that is generally comfortable to view, as opposed to identifying an appropriate location in 3D space which is subject to the physical space the user will be located in. If used to display information, care must be taken to avoid displaying information that needs to be viewed over sustained intervals of time, to avoid physical strain.RationaleQuick access to data and resources, similar to checking a wristwatch. 







SetClassroom desks where each student works on interactive virtual modelsSocialThe resources in each user’s palm menu can be distributed to encourage positive interdependence for a collaborative task. The teacher may have unlimited resources, and possibly a way to reset the state of the experience in this menu.EpistemicTo allow students and teachers to have access to resources and information that they can use at their discretion while performing a pedagogical task. 







Example use cases: inventory of atoms to build molecules with (chemistry), checking constraints of the current task (general use)

Proposed Design Patterns 













Gesture-based Dynamic Descriptor 

Gesture-based Dynamic Descriptor 

Learner Content Interaction 

Learner Content Interaction 




ProblemThere is a need to display information about a virtual object that is hidden until prompted by the user.SolutionThe user can use a specific gesture (like pointing) to reveal more information about virtual elements. This can be used as a labelling system, to reveal short blocks of text or images. This pattern does not apply to showing large blocks of text or information that the user needs to view for a sustained time interval, due to the associated physical strain. It might be appropriate to use this gesture on specific “label” points to give the user a clearer direction for where to point.RationaleWhile the user may want more information, there is a need for some of it to be hidden so as to not overwhelm the user. It is also desirable to have a separation of interaction between revealing more information and changing the state of a virtual object. This prevents the user from accidentally changing the state of an object when trying to observe it or vice versa. 







SetClassroom desks where each student works on interactive virtual modelsSocialStudents are only able to see the descriptors in their view, and cannot see the descriptors being viewed by their peers. The teacher should be able to point out descriptors in the students view to aid in a discussion about the object.EpistemicTo hide labels until students need to see them, avoiding distractions and allowing for memorizing.

Feedback Area 

Feedback Area

ProblemThere is a need to display more information about a virtual object, in a manner that can be easily integrated into the flow of work.SolutionThe user can place virtual objects in an area that displays the desired information about them. The feedback area might be represented as, i. Pedestal – Place an object on the pedestal to view a short descriptor label that becomes visible in close vicinity to the object. ii. Dashboard – A specific receptacle to hold objects, combined with a virtual screen that can display more information like charts, graphs etc. iii. Vending Machine – Insert the virtual object into the “machine” to get objects or data as output. Users often need prompting to use the feedback area. The use of the area could be scaffolded at first and then left up to the user. Alternatively, it can be integrated into the task such that using it is a mandatory step. It may not be appropriate for use for larger virtual objects, as it might be required to move them into another area and back again.RationaleIt is necessary to view information about the state of a virtual object, perhaps for sustained periods of time.
