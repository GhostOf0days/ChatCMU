A new Science Translational Medicine perspective authored by researchers in Carnegie Mellon University’s Regenerative Biomaterials and Therapeutics Group examines core challenges to overcome in the field of 3D bioprinting and essential milestones to translate to the clinic.
“This viewpoint takes into consideration technological advancements in the field to-date, as well as our opinion of the work that’s still needed in order to 3D bioprint patient-specific tissues for repair, regeneration, and replacement,” explained Jacqueline Bliley, a post-doctoral fellow and first author of the piece. “In the bioprinting space, our lab is best known for introducing FRESH technology, a technique that allows for the 3D printing of soft materials, including cells and extracellular matrix, into complex tissue architectures. This technology enables the fabrication of vascular scaffolds, heart valves, and even contractile heart muscle tissues.”

Summary of FRESH technology’s capabilities.



In terms of key challenges and requirements for translating 3D-bioprinted tissues and organs for human benefit, the group suggests that a series of advances are needed within the engineering, medical, and biological sciences. These include:

Faster 3D bioprinters that create larger and more complex tissues
Optimized bioinks and biomaterials
The ability to expand large numbers of cells and differentiate them to target cell types
Vascularization and perfusion of volumetric tissue
Immune tolerance to ensure long-term viability in patients
Nondestructive validation of tissue structure
Validation of the tissue and organ function that will be required for successful clinical translation.

“In 2022, the first 3D bioprinted human tissue was implanted in patients, a major milestone,” said Adam Feinberg, a professor of biomedical engineering and materials science and engineering and co-author. “So now it is no longer a question of if we can bioengineer new tissues and organs, but rather when we can translate that to the clinic and achieve FDA approval so everyone can benefit.”
