The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy has studied how robots can be used to teach Computer Science, Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics in K-12 education, as well as the Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes required by industry for over 20 years. Our certifications and microcertifications cover a wide variety of topics and each represents an individual's grasp on key areas identified through our research. Certifications and microcertifications are not comprised of a knowledge exam alone. As learners progress through the curriculum, they earn badges and upload computational artifacts (evidence such as coding solutions, pseudocode, photos of robot builds, wiring diagrams, etc.) that reflect their understanding.Below are our featured certifications and microcertifications, which are delivered through the CS-STEM Network (CS2N). Each certification and microcertification is available at an educator level, made available through our professional development, and at a learner level, made available to certified instructors. Educator level certifications are widely accepted as continuing education credits. The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy leverages best-in-class robotics platforms to help educators and students reach meaningful learning gains in computational thinking, mathematics, coding, and the engineering process. Certifications are available for educators and students who leverage these robotics platforms in their learning environments. Coding and Computational Thinking with LEGO SPIKE PrimeMore InformationCoding and Computational Thinking with VEX V5More InformationIntroduction to Programming: VEX IQ (VEXcode Blocks)More InformationThe Robotics Technician Microcertifications are the result of a research project funded by the ARM Institute, called the Smart Manufacturing and Advanced Robotics Training (SMART) Project.

 Research-Based Certifications and Microcertifications
The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy has studied how robots can be used to teach Computer Science, Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics in K-12 education, as well as the Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes required by industry for over 20 years. Our certifications and microcertifications cover a wide variety of topics and each represents an individual's grasp on key areas identified through our research. Certifications and microcertifications are not comprised of a knowledge exam alone. As learners progress through the curriculum, they earn badges and upload computational artifacts (evidence such as coding solutions, pseudocode, photos of robot builds, wiring diagrams, etc.) that reflect their understanding.




At the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, we leverage a "train the trainer" model to enable our curriculum, certifications, and microcertifications to make a large impact while helping to guarantee that implementations are positive and effective for learners. Educators who have been trained and certified by the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy are able to offer certification opportunities for their students. Internationally, we also collaborate closely with Educational Partners to train and certify their Master Trainers so that they can offer high-quality programs in their regions.



Below are our featured certifications and microcertifications, which are delivered through the CS-STEM Network (CS2N). Each certification and microcertification is available at an educator level, made available through our professional development, and at a learner level, made available to certified instructors. Educator level certifications are widely accepted as continuing education credits. 
Featured Mobile Robotics Certifications
The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy leverages best-in-class robotics platforms to help educators and students reach meaningful learning gains in computational thinking, mathematics, coding, and the engineering process. Certifications are available for educators and students who leverage these robotics platforms in their learning environments.

Earn SMART Microcertifications through Robotics Competitions
Participants of the FIRST Robotics Competition and VEX Robotics Competition learn an incredible amount from these experiences, but many potential schools and employers are unaware of the specific Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes that are fostered. Participants who have gone through at least one competition season can now provide evidence of their experience to earn SMART Robotics Technician Micro-Certifications from the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, and more clearly showcase their abilities.

Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy  Use educational affordances of robotics to create CS-STEM opportunities for all learners


Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy
                                      ›              Training
    
                                                  ›              Certifications
                            


 Research-Based Certifications and Microcertifications
The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy has studied how robots can be used to teach Computer Science, Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics in K-12 education, as well as the Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes required by industry for over 20 years. Our certifications and microcertifications cover a wide variety of topics and each represents an individual's grasp on key areas identified through our research. Certifications and microcertifications are not comprised of a knowledge exam alone. As learners progress through the curriculum, they earn badges and upload computational artifacts (evidence such as coding solutions, pseudocode, photos of robot builds, wiring diagrams, etc.) that reflect their understanding.




At the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, we leverage a "train the trainer" model to enable our curriculum, certifications, and microcertifications to make a large impact while helping to guarantee that implementations are positive and effective for learners. Educators who have been trained and certified by the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy are able to offer certification opportunities for their students. Internationally, we also collaborate closely with Educational Partners to train and certify their Master Trainers so that they can offer high-quality programs in their regions.



Below are our featured certifications and microcertifications, which are delivered through the CS-STEM Network (CS2N). Each certification and microcertification is available at an educator level, made available through our professional development, and at a learner level, made available to certified instructors. Educator level certifications are widely accepted as continuing education credits. 
Featured Mobile Robotics Certifications
The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy leverages best-in-class robotics platforms to help educators and students reach meaningful learning gains in computational thinking, mathematics, coding, and the engineering process. Certifications are available for educators and students who leverage these robotics platforms in their learning environments.

Earn SMART Microcertifications through Robotics Competitions
Participants of the FIRST Robotics Competition and VEX Robotics Competition learn an incredible amount from these experiences, but many potential schools and employers are unaware of the specific Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes that are fostered. Participants who have gone through at least one competition season can now provide evidence of their experience to earn SMART Robotics Technician Micro-Certifications from the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, and more clearly showcase their abilities.

  Research-Based Certifications and Microcertifications
The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy has studied how robots can be used to teach Computer Science, Science, Technology Engineering, and Mathematics in K-12 education, as well as the Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes required by industry for over 20 years. Our certifications and microcertifications cover a wide variety of topics and each represents an individual's grasp on key areas identified through our research. Certifications and microcertifications are not comprised of a knowledge exam alone. As learners progress through the curriculum, they earn badges and upload computational artifacts (evidence such as coding solutions, pseudocode, photos of robot builds, wiring diagrams, etc.) that reflect their understanding.




At the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, we leverage a "train the trainer" model to enable our curriculum, certifications, and microcertifications to make a large impact while helping to guarantee that implementations are positive and effective for learners. Educators who have been trained and certified by the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy are able to offer certification opportunities for their students. Internationally, we also collaborate closely with Educational Partners to train and certify their Master Trainers so that they can offer high-quality programs in their regions.



Below are our featured certifications and microcertifications, which are delivered through the CS-STEM Network (CS2N). Each certification and microcertification is available at an educator level, made available through our professional development, and at a learner level, made available to certified instructors. Educator level certifications are widely accepted as continuing education credits. 
Featured Mobile Robotics Certifications
The Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy leverages best-in-class robotics platforms to help educators and students reach meaningful learning gains in computational thinking, mathematics, coding, and the engineering process. Certifications are available for educators and students who leverage these robotics platforms in their learning environments.

Earn SMART Microcertifications through Robotics Competitions
Participants of the FIRST Robotics Competition and VEX Robotics Competition learn an incredible amount from these experiences, but many potential schools and employers are unaware of the specific Knowledge, Skills, and Attitudes that are fostered. Participants who have gone through at least one competition season can now provide evidence of their experience to earn SMART Robotics Technician Micro-Certifications from the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Academy, and more clearly showcase their abilities.
