Week 6 Summary 



Now we are moving to second round of rapid prototyping. Our high-level concept is using rainforest outline and organisms to explore layer content interactions. Layered model is something that is recurring among other subjects, so after creating layer prototype, we expect future researchers to use this prototype as a template for future education content.We refined line prototype to explore visual cues for natural gesture language while exploring the image tracking for our platform 



Round 2 Rapid Prototyping 



 



Earlier this semester, we pitched our idea of a layered model for teaching biomes to a group of teachers, and they pointed out that it would be very useful to have a similar model to teach archaeology. We realized that layers are a repeating pattern across more than one subjects, so we decided to implement an interactive layer model to explore those interactions.Our future plan is to use drawers as a layer and cube as an interactable object. 




 




Refining Line Prototype 



While exploring gesture language, we notice the importance of refining visual cues more and more. Therefore, we made more visual cues for interacting with lines to make the interaction less tedious.

We are now tackling image tracking in depth. Previously, we used Vuforia for image tracking; however, since ZED is a stereo camera, it did not work well with Vuforia because it is good with device that use single camera such as the HoloLens.
