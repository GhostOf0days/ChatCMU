Our graduate programs consistently rank among the top in the nation, and we're highly ranked in specialty areas such as programming languages, artificial intelligence, systems and theory.At the undergraduate level, we introduced the nation's first bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence in 2018 and added a bachelor's program in human-computer interaction to our offerings in 2020. Our students from these and our programs in computer science and computational biology leave CMU set to join industry without missing a beat, or to attend some of the best graduate schools in the country.
