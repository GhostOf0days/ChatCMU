How to Apply for TRANSFER/DUAL DEGREE in Computer ScienceStudents in other School of Computer Science (SCS) majors who wish to transfer to Computer Science should apply for transfer using this online form. There are no grade restrictions for SCS students who wish to transfer into Computer Science. However, transfer decisions will be based on the student's essay (reflective statement) and overall academic progress. Prior to submitting a transfer request, students should first make an appointment with the CS Undergraduate Program Administrator: Amy Weis, for an initial evaluation.CMU students in majors outside of SCS can apply for transfer into the Computer Science major or a dual degree in Computer Science using this online form. Students considering a transfer or dual degree are expected to earn at least a 3.6 QPA in 15-122, 15-150, 15-210, 15-213, 15-251 and 21-127, and have an overall 3.0 QPA.   Students may apply for transfer by the mid-semester break (or end of summer session) in the semester when the last of the six required courses will be completed. In the case of courses in progress, the midsemester grades will be used in the QPA calculation. The decision to allow for transfer will be made by committee based on the student's academic performance (in the specified courses and in their courses overall if necessary), a required essay (1-2 pages) that explains their interest and goals in Computer Science, additional involvement in SCS and other computing-related activities, and availability of space in the student's class level.Transfer to or Dual Degree in the Computer Science program for non-SCS students is not guaranteed, and students should continue to make progress in their current major and discuss their plans with their academic advisor carefully in the event that a transfer is not possible.
