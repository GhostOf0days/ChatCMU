 Sonic Arts
Sonic Art is a creative expression that uses sound as its primary medium. Just as visual artists create landscapes, portraits, and narratives through light, color, and form, sonic artists craft transformative experiences through sound, noise, and music.
Students in the Sonic Arts minor explore the processes and products of digital sound design and music production. They receive basic training in key component areas: principles of computer music, sound synthesis, spatialization, and core practices in sound design. Combining this training with courses that bring together experts from many disciplines, they create experimental music and explore emerging applications and markets for sound design, music creation, and performance.

Create meaning with sound



IDeATe
                                      ›              Undergraduate Programs
    
                                                  ›              Sonic Arts
                            


 Sonic Arts
Sonic Art is a creative expression that uses sound as its primary medium. Just as visual artists create landscapes, portraits, and narratives through light, color, and form, sonic artists craft transformative experiences through sound, noise, and music.
Students in the Sonic Arts minor explore the processes and products of digital sound design and music production. They receive basic training in key component areas: principles of computer music, sound synthesis, spatialization, and core practices in sound design. Combining this training with courses that bring together experts from many disciplines, they create experimental music and explore emerging applications and markets for sound design, music creation, and performance.
