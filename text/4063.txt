The College of Engineering




Our world is changing faster than ever before, and its problems are bigger and more complicated. Knowledge used to advance from insight to insight, but its once steady expansion has turned exponential. At the intersection of emerging voices and data, complex issues are arising — demanding new models for collaboration. Now more than ever, we must work together to innovate.








Carnegie Mellon engineers are constructing a better world: one that is energy-efficient and more connected, where technology can be trusted. We will drive the technological leaps that will create the future.
The College of Engineering is doing work that people can see, touch and imagine in their daily lives. Your support will drive our transformation and lift our reputation. More important, youʼll help elevate expectations of how exceptional tomorrow can be.

The College of Engineering




Our world is changing faster than ever before, and its problems are bigger and more complicated. Knowledge used to advance from insight to insight, but its once steady expansion has turned exponential. At the intersection of emerging voices and data, complex issues are arising — demanding new models for collaboration. Now more than ever, we must work together to innovate.








Carnegie Mellon engineers are constructing a better world: one that is energy-efficient and more connected, where technology can be trusted. We will drive the technological leaps that will create the future.
The College of Engineering is doing work that people can see, touch and imagine in their daily lives. Your support will drive our transformation and lift our reputation. More important, youʼll help elevate expectations of how exceptional tomorrow can be.

Transform Scaife Hall into a state-of-the-art learning and research environment — including a robotics laboratory and an interdisciplinary cyberphysical systems laboratory — that gives future engineers a starting point for forging bold new paths.














 

With your support of our innovative engineers, we will:
Attract and retain the best and brightest
Advance technology-enhanced teaching and learning



Endowed Professorships
Support for endowed professorships provides our renowned faculty
with needed funding and greater freedom in their research.
Endowed Fellowships
By providing graduate fellowships for our best and brightest students, we can enable these growing innovators to tackle real-world challenges in the lab, explore new ideas in the classroom and collaborate with leading professionals in industry.
Innovation Funds
These funds will help to address the most urgent needs of the college and its departments, providing resources for breakthrough research projects, equipment for labs or experiential learning opportunities.

 













 

With your support of our multidimensional learning approach, we will:
Cultivate the maker ecosystem
Catalyze learning outside the classroom and lab
Grow the leaders of tomorrow



Maker Ecosystem
We’ll support programming and initiatives across our maker ecosystem, in places like the Tech Spark and ANSYS Hall. For example, we’ll develop additional opportunities and cutting-edge curriculum to enable our students to pursue research and inventive hands-on learning.
Undergraduate Research and Travel Funds
With this funding, we’ll help our students grow through experiences and initiatives that promote discovery and understanding across disciplines and cultures.
Equipment and Instruction Funds
By creating access to state-of-the-art equipment and resources, we’ll improve the capabilities of faculty and students to conduct groundbreaking research.
