MoralityPlay_Newsletter Week 15THIS WEEK (4/29/13 – 5/3/13)
Playtesting
Over the weekend, we had many people come in and run through our experience to see both how the enjoyed the prototype, as well as find any bugs or glitches in the project.  The majority of our playtesters enjoyed our experience, and thought that the prototype covered the issue in an informative and unbiased manner while still being entertaining to the user.  We did have a few issues, such as text that needed to be rewritten, clarity of the infographics information, and some navigation issues, but overall, it was a major success.  We even had a faculty member tell us that their concern of not representing a balanced take on the matter of economic inequality.Finalization
Taking the feedback we received from our playtests, we have made the necessary adjustments to our website to make it the best it can possibly be for finals.  The buttons have been changed from icons to actual words, the infographics convey the information much more clearly, and all of the grammatical errors have been eliminated.NEXT WEEK (5/6/13 – 5/10/13)
This is the end, beautiful friend.  Finals are right around the corner, not only do we have to present to faculty, but we also have to show our prototype to the philosophy class on Monday night.  It is going to be a busy week at the beginning of it, but it will give us time to breathe, relax, and congratulate ourselves on a job well done later in the week. Your email address will not be published.
