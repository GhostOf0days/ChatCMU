Tartan Scholars program uses individual connection to spur collective change By Elizabeth SpeedWhat can $15 dollars do? On a college campus, it can be the cost of an app required for a class. It’s the fee to join a club of like-minded students or grab a meal with a new friend.For some students, funding just one of these small expenses is a stretch, and going for all of them is out of the question. It’s just one of little things that can add up and leave new students feeling conflicted, disconnected and discouraged. Launched in 2019, Carnegie Mellon University’s Tartan Scholars program is a lens to look for — and mitigate — barriers to equity like these for the university’s undergrads.“Tartan Scholars has given the university an opportunity to take a look at itself critically and think about what we can be doing differently,” says Branden Ballard, Tartan Scholars program manager. “Where are our blind spots? Where are there gaps in the way that we’re delivering our number one product, which is education, and our number two product, which is servicing the well-being of all students? What are we missing? These are conversations that get people thinking about more equitable ways of doing things.”Ballard absolutely delights in helping his cohorts of “little baby geniuses,” as he calls them, navigate the CMU first-year experience through the Tartan Scholars program’s focus on incoming students. Reducing fees is a small but meaningful change, but there are bigger conversations underway as well.“There are educational gaps facing Black and brown students pursuing math and science majors, for example,” says Diane Hightower, director of student academic support programs. “It’s very difficult for students who didn’t have strong math, science and STEM classes in their high school curriculums to excel in their first year. After recognizing the gaps, we engaged two CMU alums who founded an organization to help incoming students build skills before they land on campus, and accelerate their academic success. Tartan Scholars allows us to deepen support and opportunities for organizations like this one.”Tartan Scholars differs from other diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and programs in a number of critical ways. First, it’s an academic support program that includes students of all races, backgrounds and nationalities. Second, students go through the same admission process as everyone else and are only invited to the program after they receive their acceptance letter for an incoming class.  “Admission is able to lift up what’s special about a particular person, meaning that they have overcome significant obstacles,” Hightower says. “This program is a response from the university to address the education and opportunity gaps that exist in our society. Sometimes these stem from the neighborhood or school district a student comes from, to cultural differences or traditions if they’re not from the United States.” Third, it works differently for each Scholar — meeting that student’s unique needs through personalized support, such as early access to dorms, community meals, individually-focused mentoring, tutoring, counseling, interpreters to communicate with families who don’t speak English, and even emergency resources. There are currently about 300 Tartan Scholars at CMU, with another 100 joining the ranks in fall 2022.  As the program heads into its fourth year, several members of the first cohort in 2019 shared their experiences as they look forward to their senior years. “Where I come from, I was raised to be a go-getter,” says MarQia Allen, a biological sciences and psychology major studying to work in medicine. She graduated from McKinley Technology High School in urban Washington, D.C., with a long list of accomplishments and leadership experiences. Going to college and succeeding in academics had never been in question, but as a first-generation college student, navigating college life meant facing unexpected challenges.Allen moved in early — a Scholars’ perk that held the most appeal for her — and on her very first day, Ballard flagged her down and offered a minifridge. In fact, Ballard had a car full of fridges and fans for incoming members of the cohort, most of whom didn’t have these two convenience items. The fridge was helpful, but the man who brought it has been indispensable.“Branden reminds me of home,” Allen says. “That’s such a dramatic statement, but it’s true. He’s the first face I saw on campus, and he’s just been here since. I stop by his office to talk about a class or a professor or what’s on my nerves. He’s like family at CMU.”Driving that sense of belonging and connection is a key component of the program. For Allen, it fosters a network of friends through community dinners, and as a shortcut to connect with advisors, mentors, tutoring and other support. The foundation was set in her first year, but she saw big benefits during her junior year when classes became more challenging and her self-care habits started to slip. She was able to meet with Ballard and sketch out a plan to get back on track.“It’s a ‘figuring it out’ thing,” Allen says. “Tartan Scholars didn’t instill grit within me. It just reinforced what I already had, and it facilitated more growth.”Allen’s high school teachers initially advised her to avoid joining out of fear that participation would separate or single her out on campus. What she’s found from the program is the opposite: a sense of inclusion, autonomy, a point toward the right direction, connection to resources and a group of people who amplify her drive.“A lot of us come to college not knowing what to expect, even if you aren’t a minoritized person,” she says. “But having this family component and getting to connect with my professors … all of that … that’s amazing.”“Branden reminds me of home. That's such a dramatic statement, but it's true. He’s the first face I saw on campus, and he’s just been here since. I stop by his office to talk about a class or a professor or what’s on my nerves. He’s like family at CMU.” Kent Shibata was born in the United States, but he moved to his family’s home country of Japan before starting eighth grade. His U.S. citizenship meant college financial aid was an option for him, which is not the case for many other international high school graduates. It put tuition in reach for his middle-class family, whose modest income wouldn’t stretch far enough to pay for his studies abroad. But there are still formidable challenges to navigate: a new culture and education system as well as his ambitious major in mechanical and biomedical engineering.“I got an email saying that I was eligible for this program for under-resourced students,” Shibata says. “I was living pretty comfortably back in Japan, so I didn’t feel like that was the big issue. But it was also a program to help you get the most out of your education. Because I spent a lot of my education in Japan, I thought maybe going into this program would help me get back into the American way of education.”Early orientation, a jump-start on social connections and financial resources to address needs far from home all eased the stress of acclimating for Shibata. He was on his way to completing a successful first year when the pandemic upended everything. He returned to Japan in March 2020, so his home became his campus on the other side of the world.“I was taking classes back home in Japan, so there was a huge time difference,” he says. “It was difficult either watching recordings or taking part in the lectures really late at night, which sometimes wasn’t really manageable.”Academics weren’t the only thing falling short when college life went virtual.“The biggest help I got during COVID-times was the social aspect. You’re far away from everyone else, sometimes it’s very hard to talk to each other,” he says. “Tartan Scholars still held online events, so we got to see other Tartan Scholars’ faces from time to time.”Shibata returned to campus in January 2021. Gearing up for his senior year, he’s reconnected with friends, gotten involved in campus groups and succeeded with academics while working on internship opportunities and looking forward to grad school after commencement.“I was fortunate enough to have the citizenship and fortunate enough to get additional financial aid from Tartan Scholars, so I am able to make it,” he says."The biggest help I got during COVID-times was the social aspect. You’re far away from everyone else, sometimes it's very hard to talk to each other. Tartan Scholars still held online events, so we got to see other Tartan Scholars’ faces from time to time."“I grew up in a household where we only spoke Spanish and was, kind of, thrust into speaking English and managing these two languages on my own in elementary school,” says Karla Tejeda. “I’ve had to translate things for my parents, like going to the doctor’s office with them and being an interpreter.”Like many of her childhood experiences, the process of going to college was also something Tejeda navigated largely on her own. Carnegie Mellon was one of about a dozen choices on her list and offered the best combination of academics and financial support. Shortly after accepting admission, she got an email with an offer of more support through the Tartan Scholars program.“In high school, the teachers always tell you, ‘Well, in college, no one’s going to be lenient, no one’s going to help you, you’re not going to have any support.’ So, I always thought, ‘I’ll just have to figure it out on my own.’”Her surprise about the program’s existence turned into excitement, and Tejeda took a spot in the inaugural year of the program.“We showed up for the week before our orientation week and got to meet each other and people who were there to support us. I absolutely loved that week. It was a really meaningful experience,” she says.Tartan Scholars also gave Tejeda someone to call when she experienced a CMU rite of passage: the first bad grade.“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for,” she says. “[A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”Tejeda entered as an English major. The Scholars program propelled her relationship with her academic advisor, who ultimately helped her connect with a new major in applied multilingual studies that’s a better fit for her goals.“My major focuses on trends and patterns and anything that has to do with bilingualism, multilingual communities and communities where there’s more than one language,” she says. “I feel there’s a gap there, and I want to go into this field and help address it because I realize that it’s really important and oftentimes overlooked.”“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for. [A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”Just like Allen, Shibata and Tejeda, every Tartan Scholar has a story about how the program’s helped them, from big impacts to small acts of support. The retention rate for Scholars stands at 98.3%, higher than the rate for all CMU students, which is already among the best nationwide. Recognizing the early success, the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh made a $10 million endowment gift in November 2021 to the Tartan Scholars program that ensures its longevity.“Education has long been a priority for the Posner Foundation through scholarships, but we recognize that additional support in various forms may be needed for different students beyond tuition,” says CMU Trustee Anne Molloy, who is also a trustee of the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh and the wife of its chairman, Henry Posner III.“We are delighted with the early results of the program like higher student retention rates, and to support these bright and determined students who are taking on leadership roles and winning academic awards. This early success moved us to secure the program’s long-term future through an endowment.”Submit your questions, comments or interest about Make Possible: The Campaign for Carnegie Mellon University using this form, and a CMU representative will be in touch soon."*" indicates required fields

What can $15 dollars do? On a college campus, it can be the cost of an app required for a class. It’s the fee to join a club of like-minded students or grab a meal with a new friend.
For some students, funding just one of these small expenses is a stretch, and going for all of them is out of the question. It’s just one of little things that can add up and leave new students feeling conflicted, disconnected and discouraged. Launched in 2019, Carnegie Mellon University’s Tartan Scholars program is a lens to look for — and mitigate — barriers to equity like these for the university’s undergrads.

Ballard absolutely delights in helping his cohorts of “little baby geniuses,” as he calls them, navigate the CMU first-year experience through the Tartan Scholars program’s focus on incoming students.

MarQia Allen Is Plugged In

Kent Shibata Is at Home
Kent Shibata was born in the United States, but he moved to his family’s home country of Japan before starting eighth grade. His U.S. citizenship meant college financial aid was an option for him, which is not the case for many other international high school graduates. It put tuition in reach for his middle-class family, whose modest income wouldn’t stretch far enough to pay for his studies abroad. But there are still formidable challenges to navigate: a new culture and education system as well as his ambitious major in mechanical and biomedical engineering.
“I got an email saying that I was eligible for this program for under-resourced students,” Shibata says. “I was living pretty comfortably back in Japan, so I didn’t feel like that was the big issue. But it was also a program to help you get the most out of your education. Because I spent a lot of my education in Japan, I thought maybe going into this program would help me get back into the American way of education.”
Early orientation, a jump-start on social connections and financial resources to address needs far from home all eased the stress of acclimating for Shibata. He was on his way to completing a successful first year when the pandemic upended everything. He returned to Japan in March 2020, so his home became his campus on the other side of the world.
“I was taking classes back home in Japan, so there was a huge time difference,” he says. “It was difficult either watching recordings or taking part in the lectures really late at night, which sometimes wasn’t really manageable.”
Academics weren’t the only thing falling short when college life went virtual.
“The biggest help I got during COVID-times was the social aspect. You’re far away from everyone else, sometimes it’s very hard to talk to each other,” he says. “Tartan Scholars still held online events, so we got to see other Tartan Scholars’ faces from time to time.”
Shibata returned to campus in January 2021. Gearing up for his senior year, he’s reconnected with friends, gotten involved in campus groups and succeeded with academics while working on internship opportunities and looking forward to grad school after commencement.
“I was fortunate enough to have the citizenship and fortunate enough to get additional financial aid from Tartan Scholars, so I am able to make it,” he says.

Karla Tejeda Is Not on Her Own
“I grew up in a household where we only spoke Spanish and was, kind of, thrust into speaking English and managing these two languages on my own in elementary school,” says Karla Tejeda. “I’ve had to translate things for my parents, like going to the doctor’s office with them and being an interpreter.”
Like many of her childhood experiences, the process of going to college was also something Tejeda navigated largely on her own. Carnegie Mellon was one of about a dozen choices on her list and offered the best combination of academics and financial support. Shortly after accepting admission, she got an email with an offer of more support through the Tartan Scholars program.
“In high school, the teachers always tell you, ‘Well, in college, no one’s going to be lenient, no one’s going to help you, you’re not going to have any support.’ So, I always thought, ‘I’ll just have to figure it out on my own.’”
Her surprise about the program’s existence turned into excitement, and Tejeda took a spot in the inaugural year of the program.
“We showed up for the week before our orientation week and got to meet each other and people who were there to support us. I absolutely loved that week. It was a really meaningful experience,” she says.
Tartan Scholars also gave Tejeda someone to call when she experienced a CMU rite of passage: the first bad grade.
“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for,” she says. “[A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”
Tejeda entered as an English major. The Scholars program propelled her relationship with her academic advisor, who ultimately helped her connect with a new major in applied multilingual studies that’s a better fit for her goals.
“My major focuses on trends and patterns and anything that has to do with bilingualism, multilingual communities and communities where there’s more than one language,” she says. “I feel there’s a gap there, and I want to go into this field and help address it because I realize that it’s really important and oftentimes overlooked.”































“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for. [A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”

Karla Tejeda, applied multilingual studies major










Endowed for Success
Just like Allen, Shibata and Tejeda, every Tartan Scholar has a story about how the program’s helped them, from big impacts to small acts of support. The retention rate for Scholars stands at 98.3%, higher than the rate for all CMU students, which is already among the best nationwide. Recognizing the early success, the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh made a $10 million endowment gift in November 2021 to the Tartan Scholars program that ensures its longevity.
Anne Molloy talks with students at the Tartan Scholars celebration.
“Education has long been a priority for the Posner Foundation through scholarships, but we recognize that additional support in various forms may be needed for different students beyond tuition,” says CMU Trustee Anne Molloy, who is also a trustee of the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh and the wife of its chairman, Henry Posner III.
“We are delighted with the early results of the program like higher student retention rates, and to support these bright and determined students who are taking on leadership roles and winning academic awards. This early success moved us to secure the program’s long-term future through an endowment.”

What can $15 dollars do? On a college campus, it can be the cost of an app required for a class. It’s the fee to join a club of like-minded students or grab a meal with a new friend.
For some students, funding just one of these small expenses is a stretch, and going for all of them is out of the question. It’s just one of little things that can add up and leave new students feeling conflicted, disconnected and discouraged. Launched in 2019, Carnegie Mellon University’s Tartan Scholars program is a lens to look for — and mitigate — barriers to equity like these for the university’s undergrads.














									Branden Ballard (center) is the manager of the Tartan Scholars program and loves engaging with his cohort of "little baby geniuses," as he calls them.								




“Tartan Scholars has given the university an opportunity to take a look at itself critically and think about what we can be doing differently,” says Branden Ballard, Tartan Scholars program manager. “Where are our blind spots? Where are there gaps in the way that we’re delivering our number one product, which is education, and our number two product, which is servicing the well-being of all students? What are we missing? These are conversations that get people thinking about more equitable ways of doing things.”
Ballard absolutely delights in helping his cohorts of “little baby geniuses,” as he calls them, navigate the CMU first-year experience through the Tartan Scholars program’s focus on incoming students. Reducing fees is a small but meaningful change, but there are bigger conversations underway as well.










“There are educational gaps facing Black and brown students pursuing math and science majors, for example,” says Diane Hightower, director of student academic support programs. “It’s very difficult for students who didn’t have strong math, science and STEM classes in their high school curriculums to excel in their first year. After recognizing the gaps, we engaged two CMU alums who founded an organization to help incoming students build skills before they land on campus, and accelerate their academic success. Tartan Scholars allows us to deepen support and opportunities for organizations like this one.”
Tartan Scholars differs from other diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and programs in a number of critical ways. First, it’s an academic support program that includes students of all races, backgrounds and nationalities. Second, students go through the same admission process as everyone else and are only invited to the program after they receive their acceptance letter for an incoming class.  














									Diane Hightower (center), is the director of student academic support programs, including Tartan Scholars.								




“Admission is able to lift up what’s special about a particular person, meaning that they have overcome significant obstacles,” Hightower says. “This program is a response from the university to address the education and opportunity gaps that exist in our society. Sometimes these stem from the neighborhood or school district a student comes from, to cultural differences or traditions if they’re not from the United States.” 
Third, it works differently for each Scholar — meeting that student’s unique needs through personalized support, such as early access to dorms, community meals, individually-focused mentoring, tutoring, counseling, interpreters to communicate with families who don’t speak English, and even emergency resources. There are currently about 300 Tartan Scholars at CMU, with another 100 joining the ranks in fall 2022.  










As the program heads into its fourth year, several members of the first cohort in 2019 shared their experiences as they look forward to their senior years. 








MarQia Allen Is Plugged In
“Where I come from, I was raised to be a go-getter,” says MarQia Allen, a biological sciences and psychology major studying to work in medicine. She graduated from McKinley Technology High School in urban Washington, D.C., with a long list of accomplishments and leadership experiences. Going to college and succeeding in academics had never been in question, but as a first-generation college student, navigating college life meant facing unexpected challenges.
Allen moved in early — a Scholars’ perk that held the most appeal for her — and on her very first day, Ballard flagged her down and offered a minifridge. In fact, Ballard had a car full of fridges and fans for incoming members of the cohort, most of whom didn’t have these two convenience items. The fridge was helpful, but the man who brought it has been indispensable.
“Branden reminds me of home,” Allen says. “That’s such a dramatic statement, but it’s true. He’s the first face I saw on campus, and he’s just been here since. I stop by his office to talk about a class or a professor or what’s on my nerves. He’s like family at CMU.”
Driving that sense of belonging and connection is a key component of the program. For Allen, it fosters a network of friends through community dinners, and as a shortcut to connect with advisors, mentors, tutoring and other support. The foundation was set in her first year, but she saw big benefits during her junior year when classes became more challenging and her self-care habits started to slip. She was able to meet with Ballard and sketch out a plan to get back on track.
“It’s a ‘figuring it out’ thing,” Allen says. “Tartan Scholars didn’t instill grit within me. It just reinforced what I already had, and it facilitated more growth.”
Allen’s high school teachers initially advised her to avoid joining out of fear that participation would separate or single her out on campus. What she’s found from the program is the opposite: a sense of inclusion, autonomy, a point toward the right direction, connection to resources and a group of people who amplify her drive.
“A lot of us come to college not knowing what to expect, even if you aren’t a minoritized person,” she says. “But having this family component and getting to connect with my professors … all of that … that’s amazing.”

Kent Shibata Is at Home
Kent Shibata was born in the United States, but he moved to his family’s home country of Japan before starting eighth grade. His U.S. citizenship meant college financial aid was an option for him, which is not the case for many other international high school graduates. It put tuition in reach for his middle-class family, whose modest income wouldn’t stretch far enough to pay for his studies abroad. But there are still formidable challenges to navigate: a new culture and education system as well as his ambitious major in mechanical and biomedical engineering.
“I got an email saying that I was eligible for this program for under-resourced students,” Shibata says. “I was living pretty comfortably back in Japan, so I didn’t feel like that was the big issue. But it was also a program to help you get the most out of your education. Because I spent a lot of my education in Japan, I thought maybe going into this program would help me get back into the American way of education.”
Early orientation, a jump-start on social connections and financial resources to address needs far from home all eased the stress of acclimating for Shibata. He was on his way to completing a successful first year when the pandemic upended everything. He returned to Japan in March 2020, so his home became his campus on the other side of the world.
“I was taking classes back home in Japan, so there was a huge time difference,” he says. “It was difficult either watching recordings or taking part in the lectures really late at night, which sometimes wasn’t really manageable.”
Academics weren’t the only thing falling short when college life went virtual.
“The biggest help I got during COVID-times was the social aspect. You’re far away from everyone else, sometimes it’s very hard to talk to each other,” he says. “Tartan Scholars still held online events, so we got to see other Tartan Scholars’ faces from time to time.”
Shibata returned to campus in January 2021. Gearing up for his senior year, he’s reconnected with friends, gotten involved in campus groups and succeeded with academics while working on internship opportunities and looking forward to grad school after commencement.
“I was fortunate enough to have the citizenship and fortunate enough to get additional financial aid from Tartan Scholars, so I am able to make it,” he says.

Karla Tejeda Is Not on Her Own
“I grew up in a household where we only spoke Spanish and was, kind of, thrust into speaking English and managing these two languages on my own in elementary school,” says Karla Tejeda. “I’ve had to translate things for my parents, like going to the doctor’s office with them and being an interpreter.”
Like many of her childhood experiences, the process of going to college was also something Tejeda navigated largely on her own. Carnegie Mellon was one of about a dozen choices on her list and offered the best combination of academics and financial support. Shortly after accepting admission, she got an email with an offer of more support through the Tartan Scholars program.
“In high school, the teachers always tell you, ‘Well, in college, no one’s going to be lenient, no one’s going to help you, you’re not going to have any support.’ So, I always thought, ‘I’ll just have to figure it out on my own.’”
Her surprise about the program’s existence turned into excitement, and Tejeda took a spot in the inaugural year of the program.
“We showed up for the week before our orientation week and got to meet each other and people who were there to support us. I absolutely loved that week. It was a really meaningful experience,” she says.
Tartan Scholars also gave Tejeda someone to call when she experienced a CMU rite of passage: the first bad grade.
“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for,” she says. “[A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”
Tejeda entered as an English major. The Scholars program propelled her relationship with her academic advisor, who ultimately helped her connect with a new major in applied multilingual studies that’s a better fit for her goals.
“My major focuses on trends and patterns and anything that has to do with bilingualism, multilingual communities and communities where there’s more than one language,” she says. “I feel there’s a gap there, and I want to go into this field and help address it because I realize that it’s really important and oftentimes overlooked.”

Endowed for Success
Just like Allen, Shibata and Tejeda, every Tartan Scholar has a story about how the program’s helped them, from big impacts to small acts of support. The retention rate for Scholars stands at 98.3%, higher than the rate for all CMU students, which is already among the best nationwide. Recognizing the early success, the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh made a $10 million endowment gift in November 2021 to the Tartan Scholars program that ensures its longevity.
Anne Molloy talks with students at the Tartan Scholars celebration.
“Education has long been a priority for the Posner Foundation through scholarships, but we recognize that additional support in various forms may be needed for different students beyond tuition,” says CMU Trustee Anne Molloy, who is also a trustee of the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh and the wife of its chairman, Henry Posner III.
“We are delighted with the early results of the program like higher student retention rates, and to support these bright and determined students who are taking on leadership roles and winning academic awards. This early success moved us to secure the program’s long-term future through an endowment.”

Investing in the Student Experience
Issue 02 | Summer 2022











What can $15 dollars do? On a college campus, it can be the cost of an app required for a class. It’s the fee to join a club of like-minded students or grab a meal with a new friend.
For some students, funding just one of these small expenses is a stretch, and going for all of them is out of the question. It’s just one of little things that can add up and leave new students feeling conflicted, disconnected and discouraged. Launched in 2019, Carnegie Mellon University’s Tartan Scholars program is a lens to look for — and mitigate — barriers to equity like these for the university’s undergrads.

“Tartan Scholars has given the university an opportunity to take a look at itself critically and think about what we can be doing differently,” says Branden Ballard, Tartan Scholars program manager. “Where are our blind spots? Where are there gaps in the way that we’re delivering our number one product, which is education, and our number two product, which is servicing the well-being of all students? What are we missing? These are conversations that get people thinking about more equitable ways of doing things.”
Ballard absolutely delights in helping his cohorts of “little baby geniuses,” as he calls them, navigate the CMU first-year experience through the Tartan Scholars program’s focus on incoming students. Reducing fees is a small but meaningful change, but there are bigger conversations underway as well.










“There are educational gaps facing Black and brown students pursuing math and science majors, for example,” says Diane Hightower, director of student academic support programs. “It’s very difficult for students who didn’t have strong math, science and STEM classes in their high school curriculums to excel in their first year. After recognizing the gaps, we engaged two CMU alums who founded an organization to help incoming students build skills before they land on campus, and accelerate their academic success. Tartan Scholars allows us to deepen support and opportunities for organizations like this one.”
Tartan Scholars differs from other diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and programs in a number of critical ways. First, it’s an academic support program that includes students of all races, backgrounds and nationalities. Second, students go through the same admission process as everyone else and are only invited to the program after they receive their acceptance letter for an incoming class.

“Admission is able to lift up what’s special about a particular person, meaning that they have overcome significant obstacles,” Hightower says. “This program is a response from the university to address the education and opportunity gaps that exist in our society. Sometimes these stem from the neighborhood or school district a student comes from, to cultural differences or traditions if they’re not from the United States.” 
Third, it works differently for each Scholar — meeting that student’s unique needs through personalized support, such as early access to dorms, community meals, individually-focused mentoring, tutoring, counseling, interpreters to communicate with families who don’t speak English, and even emergency resources. There are currently about 300 Tartan Scholars at CMU, with another 100 joining the ranks in fall 2022.  










As the program heads into its fourth year, several members of the first cohort in 2019 shared their experiences as they look forward to their senior years. 








MarQia Allen Is Plugged In
“Where I come from, I was raised to be a go-getter,” says MarQia Allen, a biological sciences and psychology major studying to work in medicine. She graduated from McKinley Technology High School in urban Washington, D.C., with a long list of accomplishments and leadership experiences. Going to college and succeeding in academics had never been in question, but as a first-generation college student, navigating college life meant facing unexpected challenges.
Allen moved in early — a Scholars’ perk that held the most appeal for her — and on her very first day, Ballard flagged her down and offered a minifridge. In fact, Ballard had a car full of fridges and fans for incoming members of the cohort, most of whom didn’t have these two convenience items. The fridge was helpful, but the man who brought it has been indispensable.
“Branden reminds me of home,” Allen says. “That’s such a dramatic statement, but it’s true. He’s the first face I saw on campus, and he’s just been here since. I stop by his office to talk about a class or a professor or what’s on my nerves. He’s like family at CMU.”
Driving that sense of belonging and connection is a key component of the program. For Allen, it fosters a network of friends through community dinners, and as a shortcut to connect with advisors, mentors, tutoring and other support. The foundation was set in her first year, but she saw big benefits during her junior year when classes became more challenging and her self-care habits started to slip. She was able to meet with Ballard and sketch out a plan to get back on track.
“It’s a ‘figuring it out’ thing,” Allen says. “Tartan Scholars didn’t instill grit within me. It just reinforced what I already had, and it facilitated more growth.”
Allen’s high school teachers initially advised her to avoid joining out of fear that participation would separate or single her out on campus. What she’s found from the program is the opposite: a sense of inclusion, autonomy, a point toward the right direction, connection to resources and a group of people who amplify her drive.
“A lot of us come to college not knowing what to expect, even if you aren’t a minoritized person,” she says. “But having this family component and getting to connect with my professors … all of that … that’s amazing.”

Kent Shibata Is at Home
Kent Shibata was born in the United States, but he moved to his family’s home country of Japan before starting eighth grade. His U.S. citizenship meant college financial aid was an option for him, which is not the case for many other international high school graduates. It put tuition in reach for his middle-class family, whose modest income wouldn’t stretch far enough to pay for his studies abroad. But there are still formidable challenges to navigate: a new culture and education system as well as his ambitious major in mechanical and biomedical engineering.
“I got an email saying that I was eligible for this program for under-resourced students,” Shibata says. “I was living pretty comfortably back in Japan, so I didn’t feel like that was the big issue. But it was also a program to help you get the most out of your education. Because I spent a lot of my education in Japan, I thought maybe going into this program would help me get back into the American way of education.”
Early orientation, a jump-start on social connections and financial resources to address needs far from home all eased the stress of acclimating for Shibata. He was on his way to completing a successful first year when the pandemic upended everything. He returned to Japan in March 2020, so his home became his campus on the other side of the world.
“I was taking classes back home in Japan, so there was a huge time difference,” he says. “It was difficult either watching recordings or taking part in the lectures really late at night, which sometimes wasn’t really manageable.”
Academics weren’t the only thing falling short when college life went virtual.
“The biggest help I got during COVID-times was the social aspect. You’re far away from everyone else, sometimes it’s very hard to talk to each other,” he says. “Tartan Scholars still held online events, so we got to see other Tartan Scholars’ faces from time to time.”
Shibata returned to campus in January 2021. Gearing up for his senior year, he’s reconnected with friends, gotten involved in campus groups and succeeded with academics while working on internship opportunities and looking forward to grad school after commencement.
“I was fortunate enough to have the citizenship and fortunate enough to get additional financial aid from Tartan Scholars, so I am able to make it,” he says.

Karla Tejeda Is Not on Her Own
“I grew up in a household where we only spoke Spanish and was, kind of, thrust into speaking English and managing these two languages on my own in elementary school,” says Karla Tejeda. “I’ve had to translate things for my parents, like going to the doctor’s office with them and being an interpreter.”
Like many of her childhood experiences, the process of going to college was also something Tejeda navigated largely on her own. Carnegie Mellon was one of about a dozen choices on her list and offered the best combination of academics and financial support. Shortly after accepting admission, she got an email with an offer of more support through the Tartan Scholars program.
“In high school, the teachers always tell you, ‘Well, in college, no one’s going to be lenient, no one’s going to help you, you’re not going to have any support.’ So, I always thought, ‘I’ll just have to figure it out on my own.’”
Her surprise about the program’s existence turned into excitement, and Tejeda took a spot in the inaugural year of the program.
“We showed up for the week before our orientation week and got to meet each other and people who were there to support us. I absolutely loved that week. It was a really meaningful experience,” she says.
Tartan Scholars also gave Tejeda someone to call when she experienced a CMU rite of passage: the first bad grade.
“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for,” she says. “[A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”
Tejeda entered as an English major. The Scholars program propelled her relationship with her academic advisor, who ultimately helped her connect with a new major in applied multilingual studies that’s a better fit for her goals.
“My major focuses on trends and patterns and anything that has to do with bilingualism, multilingual communities and communities where there’s more than one language,” she says. “I feel there’s a gap there, and I want to go into this field and help address it because I realize that it’s really important and oftentimes overlooked.”

Endowed for Success
Just like Allen, Shibata and Tejeda, every Tartan Scholar has a story about how the program’s helped them, from big impacts to small acts of support. The retention rate for Scholars stands at 98.3%, higher than the rate for all CMU students, which is already among the best nationwide. Recognizing the early success, the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh made a $10 million endowment gift in November 2021 to the Tartan Scholars program that ensures its longevity.
Anne Molloy talks with students at the Tartan Scholars celebration.
“Education has long been a priority for the Posner Foundation through scholarships, but we recognize that additional support in various forms may be needed for different students beyond tuition,” says CMU Trustee Anne Molloy, who is also a trustee of the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh and the wife of its chairman, Henry Posner III.
“We are delighted with the early results of the program like higher student retention rates, and to support these bright and determined students who are taking on leadership roles and winning academic awards. This early success moved us to secure the program’s long-term future through an endowment.”

Investing in the Student Experience
Issue 02 | Summer 2022











What can $15 dollars do? On a college campus, it can be the cost of an app required for a class. It’s the fee to join a club of like-minded students or grab a meal with a new friend.
For some students, funding just one of these small expenses is a stretch, and going for all of them is out of the question. It’s just one of little things that can add up and leave new students feeling conflicted, disconnected and discouraged. Launched in 2019, Carnegie Mellon University’s Tartan Scholars program is a lens to look for — and mitigate — barriers to equity like these for the university’s undergrads.














									Branden Ballard (center) is the manager of the Tartan Scholars program and loves engaging with his cohort of "little baby geniuses," as he calls them.								




“Tartan Scholars has given the university an opportunity to take a look at itself critically and think about what we can be doing differently,” says Branden Ballard, Tartan Scholars program manager. “Where are our blind spots? Where are there gaps in the way that we’re delivering our number one product, which is education, and our number two product, which is servicing the well-being of all students? What are we missing? These are conversations that get people thinking about more equitable ways of doing things.”
Ballard absolutely delights in helping his cohorts of “little baby geniuses,” as he calls them, navigate the CMU first-year experience through the Tartan Scholars program’s focus on incoming students. Reducing fees is a small but meaningful change, but there are bigger conversations underway as well.










“There are educational gaps facing Black and brown students pursuing math and science majors, for example,” says Diane Hightower, director of student academic support programs. “It’s very difficult for students who didn’t have strong math, science and STEM classes in their high school curriculums to excel in their first year. After recognizing the gaps, we engaged two CMU alums who founded an organization to help incoming students build skills before they land on campus, and accelerate their academic success. Tartan Scholars allows us to deepen support and opportunities for organizations like this one.”
Tartan Scholars differs from other diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and programs in a number of critical ways. First, it’s an academic support program that includes students of all races, backgrounds and nationalities. Second, students go through the same admission process as everyone else and are only invited to the program after they receive their acceptance letter for an incoming class.

“Admission is able to lift up what’s special about a particular person, meaning that they have overcome significant obstacles,” Hightower says. “This program is a response from the university to address the education and opportunity gaps that exist in our society. Sometimes these stem from the neighborhood or school district a student comes from, to cultural differences or traditions if they’re not from the United States.” 
Third, it works differently for each Scholar — meeting that student’s unique needs through personalized support, such as early access to dorms, community meals, individually-focused mentoring, tutoring, counseling, interpreters to communicate with families who don’t speak English, and even emergency resources. There are currently about 300 Tartan Scholars at CMU, with another 100 joining the ranks in fall 2022.  










As the program heads into its fourth year, several members of the first cohort in 2019 shared their experiences as they look forward to their senior years. 








MarQia Allen Is Plugged In
“Where I come from, I was raised to be a go-getter,” says MarQia Allen, a biological sciences and psychology major studying to work in medicine. She graduated from McKinley Technology High School in urban Washington, D.C., with a long list of accomplishments and leadership experiences. Going to college and succeeding in academics had never been in question, but as a first-generation college student, navigating college life meant facing unexpected challenges.
Allen moved in early — a Scholars’ perk that held the most appeal for her — and on her very first day, Ballard flagged her down and offered a minifridge. In fact, Ballard had a car full of fridges and fans for incoming members of the cohort, most of whom didn’t have these two convenience items. The fridge was helpful, but the man who brought it has been indispensable.
“Branden reminds me of home,” Allen says. “That’s such a dramatic statement, but it’s true. He’s the first face I saw on campus, and he’s just been here since. I stop by his office to talk about a class or a professor or what’s on my nerves. He’s like family at CMU.”
Driving that sense of belonging and connection is a key component of the program. For Allen, it fosters a network of friends through community dinners, and as a shortcut to connect with advisors, mentors, tutoring and other support. The foundation was set in her first year, but she saw big benefits during her junior year when classes became more challenging and her self-care habits started to slip. She was able to meet with Ballard and sketch out a plan to get back on track.
“It’s a ‘figuring it out’ thing,” Allen says. “Tartan Scholars didn’t instill grit within me. It just reinforced what I already had, and it facilitated more growth.”
Allen’s high school teachers initially advised her to avoid joining out of fear that participation would separate or single her out on campus. What she’s found from the program is the opposite: a sense of inclusion, autonomy, a point toward the right direction, connection to resources and a group of people who amplify her drive.
“A lot of us come to college not knowing what to expect, even if you aren’t a minoritized person,” she says. “But having this family component and getting to connect with my professors … all of that … that’s amazing.”

Kent Shibata Is at Home
Kent Shibata was born in the United States, but he moved to his family’s home country of Japan before starting eighth grade. His U.S. citizenship meant college financial aid was an option for him, which is not the case for many other international high school graduates. It put tuition in reach for his middle-class family, whose modest income wouldn’t stretch far enough to pay for his studies abroad. But there are still formidable challenges to navigate: a new culture and education system as well as his ambitious major in mechanical and biomedical engineering.
“I got an email saying that I was eligible for this program for under-resourced students,” Shibata says. “I was living pretty comfortably back in Japan, so I didn’t feel like that was the big issue. But it was also a program to help you get the most out of your education. Because I spent a lot of my education in Japan, I thought maybe going into this program would help me get back into the American way of education.”
Early orientation, a jump-start on social connections and financial resources to address needs far from home all eased the stress of acclimating for Shibata. He was on his way to completing a successful first year when the pandemic upended everything. He returned to Japan in March 2020, so his home became his campus on the other side of the world.
“I was taking classes back home in Japan, so there was a huge time difference,” he says. “It was difficult either watching recordings or taking part in the lectures really late at night, which sometimes wasn’t really manageable.”
Academics weren’t the only thing falling short when college life went virtual.
“The biggest help I got during COVID-times was the social aspect. You’re far away from everyone else, sometimes it’s very hard to talk to each other,” he says. “Tartan Scholars still held online events, so we got to see other Tartan Scholars’ faces from time to time.”
Shibata returned to campus in January 2021. Gearing up for his senior year, he’s reconnected with friends, gotten involved in campus groups and succeeded with academics while working on internship opportunities and looking forward to grad school after commencement.
“I was fortunate enough to have the citizenship and fortunate enough to get additional financial aid from Tartan Scholars, so I am able to make it,” he says.

Karla Tejeda Is Not on Her Own
“I grew up in a household where we only spoke Spanish and was, kind of, thrust into speaking English and managing these two languages on my own in elementary school,” says Karla Tejeda. “I’ve had to translate things for my parents, like going to the doctor’s office with them and being an interpreter.”
Like many of her childhood experiences, the process of going to college was also something Tejeda navigated largely on her own. Carnegie Mellon was one of about a dozen choices on her list and offered the best combination of academics and financial support. Shortly after accepting admission, she got an email with an offer of more support through the Tartan Scholars program.
“In high school, the teachers always tell you, ‘Well, in college, no one’s going to be lenient, no one’s going to help you, you’re not going to have any support.’ So, I always thought, ‘I’ll just have to figure it out on my own.’”
Her surprise about the program’s existence turned into excitement, and Tejeda took a spot in the inaugural year of the program.
“We showed up for the week before our orientation week and got to meet each other and people who were there to support us. I absolutely loved that week. It was a really meaningful experience,” she says.
Tartan Scholars also gave Tejeda someone to call when she experienced a CMU rite of passage: the first bad grade.
“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for,” she says. “[A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”
Tejeda entered as an English major. The Scholars program propelled her relationship with her academic advisor, who ultimately helped her connect with a new major in applied multilingual studies that’s a better fit for her goals.
“My major focuses on trends and patterns and anything that has to do with bilingualism, multilingual communities and communities where there’s more than one language,” she says. “I feel there’s a gap there, and I want to go into this field and help address it because I realize that it’s really important and oftentimes overlooked.”

Endowed for Success
Just like Allen, Shibata and Tejeda, every Tartan Scholar has a story about how the program’s helped them, from big impacts to small acts of support. The retention rate for Scholars stands at 98.3%, higher than the rate for all CMU students, which is already among the best nationwide. Recognizing the early success, the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh made a $10 million endowment gift in November 2021 to the Tartan Scholars program that ensures its longevity.
Anne Molloy talks with students at the Tartan Scholars celebration.
“Education has long been a priority for the Posner Foundation through scholarships, but we recognize that additional support in various forms may be needed for different students beyond tuition,” says CMU Trustee Anne Molloy, who is also a trustee of the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh and the wife of its chairman, Henry Posner III.
“We are delighted with the early results of the program like higher student retention rates, and to support these bright and determined students who are taking on leadership roles and winning academic awards. This early success moved us to secure the program’s long-term future through an endowment.”

“There are educational gaps facing Black and brown students pursuing math and science majors, for example,” says Diane Hightower, director of student academic support programs. “It’s very difficult for students who didn’t have strong math, science and STEM classes in their high school curriculums to excel in their first year. After recognizing the gaps, we engaged two CMU alums who founded an organization to help incoming students build skills before they land on campus, and accelerate their academic success. Tartan Scholars allows us to deepen support and opportunities for organizations like this one.”
Tartan Scholars differs from other diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and programs in a number of critical ways. First, it’s an academic support program that includes students of all races, backgrounds and nationalities. Second, students go through the same admission process as everyone else and are only invited to the program after they receive their acceptance letter for an incoming class.

“Admission is able to lift up what’s special about a particular person, meaning that they have overcome significant obstacles,” Hightower says. “This program is a response from the university to address the education and opportunity gaps that exist in our society. Sometimes these stem from the neighborhood or school district a student comes from, to cultural differences or traditions if they’re not from the United States.” 
Third, it works differently for each Scholar — meeting that student’s unique needs through personalized support, such as early access to dorms, community meals, individually-focused mentoring, tutoring, counseling, interpreters to communicate with families who don’t speak English, and even emergency resources. There are currently about 300 Tartan Scholars at CMU, with another 100 joining the ranks in fall 2022.  










As the program heads into its fourth year, several members of the first cohort in 2019 shared their experiences as they look forward to their senior years. 








MarQia Allen Is Plugged In
“Where I come from, I was raised to be a go-getter,” says MarQia Allen, a biological sciences and psychology major studying to work in medicine. She graduated from McKinley Technology High School in urban Washington, D.C., with a long list of accomplishments and leadership experiences. Going to college and succeeding in academics had never been in question, but as a first-generation college student, navigating college life meant facing unexpected challenges.
Allen moved in early — a Scholars’ perk that held the most appeal for her — and on her very first day, Ballard flagged her down and offered a minifridge. In fact, Ballard had a car full of fridges and fans for incoming members of the cohort, most of whom didn’t have these two convenience items. The fridge was helpful, but the man who brought it has been indispensable.
“Branden reminds me of home,” Allen says. “That’s such a dramatic statement, but it’s true. He’s the first face I saw on campus, and he’s just been here since. I stop by his office to talk about a class or a professor or what’s on my nerves. He’s like family at CMU.”
Driving that sense of belonging and connection is a key component of the program. For Allen, it fosters a network of friends through community dinners, and as a shortcut to connect with advisors, mentors, tutoring and other support. The foundation was set in her first year, but she saw big benefits during her junior year when classes became more challenging and her self-care habits started to slip. She was able to meet with Ballard and sketch out a plan to get back on track.
“It’s a ‘figuring it out’ thing,” Allen says. “Tartan Scholars didn’t instill grit within me. It just reinforced what I already had, and it facilitated more growth.”
Allen’s high school teachers initially advised her to avoid joining out of fear that participation would separate or single her out on campus. What she’s found from the program is the opposite: a sense of inclusion, autonomy, a point toward the right direction, connection to resources and a group of people who amplify her drive.
“A lot of us come to college not knowing what to expect, even if you aren’t a minoritized person,” she says. “But having this family component and getting to connect with my professors … all of that … that’s amazing.”

Kent Shibata Is at Home
Kent Shibata was born in the United States, but he moved to his family’s home country of Japan before starting eighth grade. His U.S. citizenship meant college financial aid was an option for him, which is not the case for many other international high school graduates. It put tuition in reach for his middle-class family, whose modest income wouldn’t stretch far enough to pay for his studies abroad. But there are still formidable challenges to navigate: a new culture and education system as well as his ambitious major in mechanical and biomedical engineering.
“I got an email saying that I was eligible for this program for under-resourced students,” Shibata says. “I was living pretty comfortably back in Japan, so I didn’t feel like that was the big issue. But it was also a program to help you get the most out of your education. Because I spent a lot of my education in Japan, I thought maybe going into this program would help me get back into the American way of education.”
Early orientation, a jump-start on social connections and financial resources to address needs far from home all eased the stress of acclimating for Shibata. He was on his way to completing a successful first year when the pandemic upended everything. He returned to Japan in March 2020, so his home became his campus on the other side of the world.
“I was taking classes back home in Japan, so there was a huge time difference,” he says. “It was difficult either watching recordings or taking part in the lectures really late at night, which sometimes wasn’t really manageable.”
Academics weren’t the only thing falling short when college life went virtual.
“The biggest help I got during COVID-times was the social aspect. You’re far away from everyone else, sometimes it’s very hard to talk to each other,” he says. “Tartan Scholars still held online events, so we got to see other Tartan Scholars’ faces from time to time.”
Shibata returned to campus in January 2021. Gearing up for his senior year, he’s reconnected with friends, gotten involved in campus groups and succeeded with academics while working on internship opportunities and looking forward to grad school after commencement.
“I was fortunate enough to have the citizenship and fortunate enough to get additional financial aid from Tartan Scholars, so I am able to make it,” he says.

Karla Tejeda Is Not on Her Own
“I grew up in a household where we only spoke Spanish and was, kind of, thrust into speaking English and managing these two languages on my own in elementary school,” says Karla Tejeda. “I’ve had to translate things for my parents, like going to the doctor’s office with them and being an interpreter.”
Like many of her childhood experiences, the process of going to college was also something Tejeda navigated largely on her own. Carnegie Mellon was one of about a dozen choices on her list and offered the best combination of academics and financial support. Shortly after accepting admission, she got an email with an offer of more support through the Tartan Scholars program.
“In high school, the teachers always tell you, ‘Well, in college, no one’s going to be lenient, no one’s going to help you, you’re not going to have any support.’ So, I always thought, ‘I’ll just have to figure it out on my own.’”
Her surprise about the program’s existence turned into excitement, and Tejeda took a spot in the inaugural year of the program.
“We showed up for the week before our orientation week and got to meet each other and people who were there to support us. I absolutely loved that week. It was a really meaningful experience,” she says.
Tartan Scholars also gave Tejeda someone to call when she experienced a CMU rite of passage: the first bad grade.
“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for,” she says. “[A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”
Tejeda entered as an English major. The Scholars program propelled her relationship with her academic advisor, who ultimately helped her connect with a new major in applied multilingual studies that’s a better fit for her goals.
“My major focuses on trends and patterns and anything that has to do with bilingualism, multilingual communities and communities where there’s more than one language,” she says. “I feel there’s a gap there, and I want to go into this field and help address it because I realize that it’s really important and oftentimes overlooked.”

Endowed for Success
Just like Allen, Shibata and Tejeda, every Tartan Scholar has a story about how the program’s helped them, from big impacts to small acts of support. The retention rate for Scholars stands at 98.3%, higher than the rate for all CMU students, which is already among the best nationwide. Recognizing the early success, the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh made a $10 million endowment gift in November 2021 to the Tartan Scholars program that ensures its longevity.
Anne Molloy talks with students at the Tartan Scholars celebration.
“Education has long been a priority for the Posner Foundation through scholarships, but we recognize that additional support in various forms may be needed for different students beyond tuition,” says CMU Trustee Anne Molloy, who is also a trustee of the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh and the wife of its chairman, Henry Posner III.
“We are delighted with the early results of the program like higher student retention rates, and to support these bright and determined students who are taking on leadership roles and winning academic awards. This early success moved us to secure the program’s long-term future through an endowment.”

What can $15 dollars do? On a college campus, it can be the cost of an app required for a class. It’s the fee to join a club of like-minded students or grab a meal with a new friend.
For some students, funding just one of these small expenses is a stretch, and going for all of them is out of the question. It’s just one of little things that can add up and leave new students feeling conflicted, disconnected and discouraged. Launched in 2019, Carnegie Mellon University’s Tartan Scholars program is a lens to look for — and mitigate — barriers to equity like these for the university’s undergrads.

“Tartan Scholars has given the university an opportunity to take a look at itself critically and think about what we can be doing differently,” says Branden Ballard, Tartan Scholars program manager. “Where are our blind spots? Where are there gaps in the way that we’re delivering our number one product, which is education, and our number two product, which is servicing the well-being of all students? What are we missing? These are conversations that get people thinking about more equitable ways of doing things.”
Ballard absolutely delights in helping his cohorts of “little baby geniuses,” as he calls them, navigate the CMU first-year experience through the Tartan Scholars program’s focus on incoming students. Reducing fees is a small but meaningful change, but there are bigger conversations underway as well.

“There are educational gaps facing Black and brown students pursuing math and science majors, for example,” says Diane Hightower, director of student academic support programs. “It’s very difficult for students who didn’t have strong math, science and STEM classes in their high school curriculums to excel in their first year.

MarQia Allen Is Plugged In
“Where I come from, I was raised to be a go-getter,” says MarQia Allen, a biological sciences and psychology major studying to work in medicine. She graduated from McKinley Technology High School in urban Washington, D.C., with a long list of accomplishments and leadership experiences. Going to college and succeeding in academics had never been in question, but as a first-generation college student, navigating college life meant facing unexpected challenges.
Allen moved in early — a Scholars’ perk that held the most appeal for her — and on her very first day, Ballard flagged her down and offered a minifridge. In fact, Ballard had a car full of fridges and fans for incoming members of the cohort, most of whom didn’t have these two convenience items. The fridge was helpful, but the man who brought it has been indispensable.
“Branden reminds me of home,” Allen says. “That’s such a dramatic statement, but it’s true. He’s the first face I saw on campus, and he’s just been here since. I stop by his office to talk about a class or a professor or what’s on my nerves. He’s like family at CMU.”
Driving that sense of belonging and connection is a key component of the program. For Allen, it fosters a network of friends through community dinners, and as a shortcut to connect with advisors, mentors, tutoring and other support. The foundation was set in her first year, but she saw big benefits during her junior year when classes became more challenging and her self-care habits started to slip. She was able to meet with Ballard and sketch out a plan to get back on track.
“It’s a ‘figuring it out’ thing,” Allen says. “Tartan Scholars didn’t instill grit within me. It just reinforced what I already had, and it facilitated more growth.”
Allen’s high school teachers initially advised her to avoid joining out of fear that participation would separate or single her out on campus. What she’s found from the program is the opposite: a sense of inclusion, autonomy, a point toward the right direction, connection to resources and a group of people who amplify her drive.
“A lot of us come to college not knowing what to expect, even if you aren’t a minoritized person,” she says. “But having this family component and getting to connect with my professors … all of that … that’s amazing.”

She was able to meet with Ballard and sketch out a plan to get back on track.
“It’s a ‘figuring it out’ thing,” Allen says. “Tartan Scholars didn’t instill grit within me. It just reinforced what I already had, and it facilitated more growth.”
Allen’s high school teachers initially advised her to avoid joining out of fear that participation would separate or single her out on campus. What she’s found from the program is the opposite: a sense of inclusion, autonomy, a point toward the right direction, connection to resources and a group of people who amplify her drive.
“A lot of us come to college not knowing what to expect, even if you aren’t a minoritized person,” she says. “But having this family component and getting to connect with my professors … all of that … that’s amazing.”


























“Branden reminds me of home. That's such a dramatic statement, but it's true. He’s the first face I saw on campus, and he’s just been here since. I stop by his office to talk about a class or a professor or what’s on my nerves. He’s like family at CMU.”

Kent Shibata Is at Home
Kent Shibata was born in the United States, but he moved to his family’s home country of Japan before starting eighth grade. His U.S. citizenship meant college financial aid was an option for him, which is not the case for many other international high school graduates. It put tuition in reach for his middle-class family, whose modest income wouldn’t stretch far enough to pay for his studies abroad. But there are still formidable challenges to navigate: a new culture and education system as well as his ambitious major in mechanical and biomedical engineering.
“I got an email saying that I was eligible for this program for under-resourced students,” Shibata says. “I was living pretty comfortably back in Japan, so I didn’t feel like that was the big issue. But it was also a program to help you get the most out of your education. Because I spent a lot of my education in Japan, I thought maybe going into this program would help me get back into the American way of education.”
Early orientation, a jump-start on social connections and financial resources to address needs far from home all eased the stress of acclimating for Shibata. He was on his way to completing a successful first year when the pandemic upended everything. He returned to Japan in March 2020, so his home became his campus on the other side of the world.
“I was taking classes back home in Japan, so there was a huge time difference,” he says. “It was difficult either watching recordings or taking part in the lectures really late at night, which sometimes wasn’t really manageable.”
Academics weren’t the only thing falling short when college life went virtual.
“The biggest help I got during COVID-times was the social aspect. You’re far away from everyone else, sometimes it’s very hard to talk to each other,” he says. “Tartan Scholars still held online events, so we got to see other Tartan Scholars’ faces from time to time.”
Shibata returned to campus in January 2021. Gearing up for his senior year, he’s reconnected with friends, gotten involved in campus groups and succeeded with academics while working on internship opportunities and looking forward to grad school after commencement.
“I was fortunate enough to have the citizenship and fortunate enough to get additional financial aid from Tartan Scholars, so I am able to make it,” he says.

Karla Tejeda Is Not on Her Own
“I grew up in a household where we only spoke Spanish and was, kind of, thrust into speaking English and managing these two languages on my own in elementary school,” says Karla Tejeda. “I’ve had to translate things for my parents, like going to the doctor’s office with them and being an interpreter.”
Like many of her childhood experiences, the process of going to college was also something Tejeda navigated largely on her own. Carnegie Mellon was one of about a dozen choices on her list and offered the best combination of academics and financial support. Shortly after accepting admission, she got an email with an offer of more support through the Tartan Scholars program.
“In high school, the teachers always tell you, ‘Well, in college, no one’s going to be lenient, no one’s going to help you, you’re not going to have any support.’ So, I always thought, ‘I’ll just have to figure it out on my own.’”
Her surprise about the program’s existence turned into excitement, and Tejeda took a spot in the inaugural year of the program.
“We showed up for the week before our orientation week and got to meet each other and people who were there to support us. I absolutely loved that week. It was a really meaningful experience,” she says.
Tartan Scholars also gave Tejeda someone to call when she experienced a CMU rite of passage: the first bad grade.
“It was the worst grade I ever got, and I was worried I could end up failing a class that I had no idea how to study for,” she says. “[A Tartan Scholars mentor] pointed me to student academic resources. They helped me adjust and find ways to improve my studying and my grade. I did end up passing the class!”
Tejeda entered as an English major. The Scholars program propelled her relationship with her academic advisor, who ultimately helped her connect with a new major in applied multilingual studies that’s a better fit for her goals.
“My major focuses on trends and patterns and anything that has to do with bilingualism, multilingual communities and communities where there’s more than one language,” she says. “I feel there’s a gap there, and I want to go into this field and help address it because I realize that it’s really important and oftentimes overlooked.”

Endowed for Success
Just like Allen, Shibata and Tejeda, every Tartan Scholar has a story about how the program’s helped them, from big impacts to small acts of support. The retention rate for Scholars stands at 98.3%, higher than the rate for all CMU students, which is already among the best nationwide. Recognizing the early success, the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh made a $10 million endowment gift in November 2021 to the Tartan Scholars program that ensures its longevity.
Anne Molloy talks with students at the Tartan Scholars celebration.
“Education has long been a priority for the Posner Foundation through scholarships, but we recognize that additional support in various forms may be needed for different students beyond tuition,” says CMU Trustee Anne Molloy, who is also a trustee of the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh and the wife of its chairman, Henry Posner III.
“We are delighted with the early results of the program like higher student retention rates, and to support these bright and determined students who are taking on leadership roles and winning academic awards. This early success moved us to secure the program’s long-term future through an endowment.”
