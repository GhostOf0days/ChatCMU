Computing Services is in the process of migrating academic and administrative buildings to a new registration system. During this transition,
 we must maintain two registration systems. 

Before you proceed, check to see if your building is on our
completed buildings list.

If your building is not on the completed building list, proceed in Net Reg.
If your building is on the completed building list, register in
GetOnline.

All machines
must be registered before you connect to the wired network.
