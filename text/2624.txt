									Mentor: Sebastian Scherer								

									Hi! I am Eric Chen, a rising junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. At Harvey Mudd, I lead a team of undergraduates to develop an autonomous underwater robot for the Robosub competition as the Vice President of Software, and I work as a machine learning research to investigate ways to quantitatively compare model assumptions, bias, and capacity with Mudd's AMISTAD Lab. I enjoy learning about all forms of perception (computer vision, deep learning, multisensor) and developing robot infrastructure. This summer, I am excited to work with Professor Sebastian Scherer and Cherie Ho in the Air Lab on an adaptive long-range perception system that predicts lidar labels using a camera for off-Road driving in the DARPA RACER competition. For this project, I aim to use the LIDAR to automatically label image data to train the model online. This self-supervised, online approach will allow our image segmentation model to adapt to the constantly changing environment of off-road driving. Working on this project allows me to contribute to the cutting edge of autonomous driving and will help me grow as a vision researcher. With my remaining time as a RISS Scholar, I hope to enrich my knowledge of robotics, meet experts in the field, and connect with the other students in my amazing cohort. I am grateful to the RISS staff, sponsors, and the AirLab team for providing me with this valuable experience.

									Mentor: John M. Dolan								

									Hello, my name is Caleb Chang and I am a rising senior studying Electrical Engineering at Georgia Tech. I am interested in controls, signal processing, and anything else robotics-related! This summer, I have the opportunity to dive deeper into the field of robotics–specifically in autonomous vehicle safety.  As part of RISS, I will be working under Dr. John M. Dolan at the Robotics Institute to tackle three primary goals regarding safety-critical control. The first is to develop a method to determine pairwise interactions between vehicles. The second is to estimate the parameters of a control barrier function from noisy observations. Third, by combining results from the first and second goals, we can develop an appropriate strategy for the ego agent to better interact with the target agent and its surrounding vehicles allowing for safer and more effective locomotion. I am super grateful to John M. Dolan, Yiwei Lyu, and those at the Robotics Institute for giving me this opportunity to work, learn, and grow to be a more mature researcher this summer.

									Mentor: Jack Mostow								

									Hello! I am Anisa Callis and I am a current mentee pursuing my passion for human-centered design majoring in Human-Centered Design and Development at Pennsylvania State University as a rising junior and a member of the Millennium Scholars Program, a highly selective program for underrepresented groups students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I have and currently am engaged in active learning and developing skills in programming languages such as Java, Python, and R, and other tools used in my field such as Figma. I gained valuable experience with research last during my research experience for undergraduates (REU) at Rochester Institute of Technology. Through that opportunity, I learned how to conduct and run an experiment for the first time. My REU experience was virtual, presenting challenges that helped me grow in new ways. I learned to work in groups differently since all interaction was over zoom. I also found ways to connect and communicate with my groupmates through a screen and develop lasting relationships with my mentors. I ultimately wish to use last summer's REU and this summer's internship to gain experiences that will help me take my skills with human-centered design and software design into industry. I also have a desire to further my curiosities by gaining my Ph.D. in Human-centered design. My goal with my future career is  to use my experiences and degree to create technological solutions that are beneficial and not harmful to the targeted users while supporting others to do the same and find their enthusiasm for technology. Through Robotics Institute of Summer Scholars (RISS) working with Dr. Jack Mostow on his project RoboTutor, I wish to continue to gain confidence in my academic and research abilities, grow in my learned ability to work in teams, gain valuable mentorship and advice with long-lasting relationships, and experiences to further my future in Human-Centered Design.

I ultimately wish to use last summer's REU and this summer's internship to gain experiences that will help me take my skills with human-centered design and software design into industry. I also have a desire to further my curiosities by gaining my Ph.D. in Human-centered design. My goal with my future career is  to use my experiences and degree to create technological solutions that are beneficial and not harmful to the targeted users while supporting others to do the same and find their enthusiasm for technology. Through Robotics Institute of Summer Scholars (RISS) working with Dr. Jack Mostow on his project RoboTutor, I wish to continue to gain confidence in my academic and research abilities, grow in my learned ability to work in teams, gain valuable mentorship and advice with long-lasting relationships, and experiences to further my future in Human-Centered Design.

									Hello, my name is Caleb Chang and I am a rising senior studying Electrical Engineering at Georgia Tech. I am interested in controls, signal processing, and anything else robotics-related! This summer, I have the opportunity to dive deeper into the field of robotics–specifically in autonomous vehicle safety.  As part of RISS, I will be working under Dr. John M. Dolan at the Robotics Institute to tackle three primary goals regarding safety-critical control. The first is to develop a method to determine pairwise interactions between vehicles. The second is to estimate the parameters of a control barrier function from noisy observations. Third, by combining results from the first and second goals, we can develop an appropriate strategy for the ego agent to better interact with the target agent and its surrounding vehicles allowing for safer and more effective locomotion. I am super grateful to John M. Dolan, Yiwei Lyu, and those at the Robotics Institute for giving me this opportunity to work, learn, and grow to be a more mature researcher this summer.

									Mentor: Jack Mostow								

									Hello! I am Anisa Callis and I am a current mentee pursuing my passion for human-centered design majoring in Human-Centered Design and Development at Pennsylvania State University as a rising junior and a member of the Millennium Scholars Program, a highly selective program for underrepresented groups students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I have and currently am engaged in active learning and developing skills in programming languages such as Java, Python, and R, and other tools used in my field such as Figma. I gained valuable experience with research last during my research experience for undergraduates (REU) at Rochester Institute of Technology. Through that opportunity, I learned how to conduct and run an experiment for the first time. My REU experience was virtual, presenting challenges that helped me grow in new ways. I learned to work in groups differently since all interaction was over zoom. I also found ways to connect and communicate with my groupmates through a screen and develop lasting relationships with my mentors. I ultimately wish to use last summer's REU and this summer's internship to gain experiences that will help me take my skills with human-centered design and software design into industry. I also have a desire to further my curiosities by gaining my Ph.D. in Human-centered design. My goal with my future career is  to use my experiences and degree to create technological solutions that are beneficial and not harmful to the targeted users while supporting others to do the same and find their enthusiasm for technology. Through Robotics Institute of Summer Scholars (RISS) working with Dr. Jack Mostow on his project RoboTutor, I wish to continue to gain confidence in my academic and research abilities, grow in my learned ability to work in teams, gain valuable mentorship and advice with long-lasting relationships, and experiences to further my future in Human-Centered Design.

									Hello! My name is Conner Pulling and I am a RISS’21 alumni and an incoming MSR graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am interested in researching and developing robotic capabilities for autonomy, reasoning, and perception in unstructured environments such as in space or underground. This summer, I am excited to work with the AirLab under the mentorship of Dr. Sebastian Scherer and Dr. Yaoyu Hu. My research with RISS will build on previous work and focus on developing novel learning-based omnidirectional depth estimation methods using multiple fisheye camera images. The goal is to run a deep learning model in real-time on an edge device to get a full 360° depth map around an agent, which could be used for 3D reconstruction, collision avoidance, and much more. I look forward to continuing my robotics research with world-renown experts while having the chance to explore Pittsburgh, CMU, and RI in-person. I believe my time with the AirLab and RISS will give me the chance to be both a mentor and a student, helping begin my graduate journey with CMU on a positive note. I want to thank my mentors, Rachel Burcin, John M. Dolan, the RISS sponsors, and the AirLab for the opportunity to learn and grow this summer!

									Hi! My name is Chigozie Ofodike and I am currently a senior at Kean University where I study computer science with an emphasis on data science. My past research has been on object detection and tracking with the help of computer vision and the applications of these technologies. Some use cases are determining if a parking spot is filled or not, detecting people in an image, then determining the distance between them for a social distancing calculator. This summer I am excited to say that I will be working under Dr. Artur Dubrawski in the Auton Lab. After my first experience with the RISS program, I became enthralled by the work happening here so much that I hope to pursue an advanced degree from CMU. At this stage, I am sure I want a degree but I am quite unsure of what I would like to focus on. My goal this time around is to explore deeply the programs available.

									Mentor: George Kantor								

									Hello! My name is Ekechi Nzewi. I am currently a junior majoring in Software Development at Georgia Gwinnett College. I am interested in Combinatorial Game Theory, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Being interested in AGI, one of my goals is to hopefully create a sentient AI. To achieve this, I have been studying the software aspect of artificial intelligence. To further aid this, I have recently been trying to get into the robotics/hardware aspect because one thing science fiction has taught me is that to achieve AGI, a physical body is necessary. In the past, I’ve done research in computational neuroscience, and data analysis. This summer, I will be working with Dr. George Kantor in the Field Robotics Centre. Dr. Kantor’s research is focused on using AI and RL in agriculture. I am looking forward to expanding my horizons and interacting with world-class researchers. I am also excited to interact with other cohort members, as well as other Carnegie Mellon researchers. I would like to thank the RISS community for providing me this great opportunity, and the sponsors for making this possible.

									Hello, I am Srujan Deolasee, a rising senior at the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, and I am pursuing a major in Computer Science. My research interests include motion planning for autonomous robots and learning-based algorithms for navigation. I have previously worked on developing a modified Hybrid A* planning algorithm for a tractor-trailer robot. This summer, I am working under the supervision of Dr. John Dolan and Dr. Qin Lin at the Argo AI Center for Autonomous Vehicle Research. I will be researching safety-guaranteed motion planning for autonomous vehicles. I hope to contribute to the previous research in speed profile planning techniques which deal with dynamic obstacle avoidance given a planned path. I aim to optimize Bezier polynomials to find a comfort-optimal trajectory for the vehicle. Being a part of the RISS community allows me to network with world-class roboticists at CMU RI. It is an invaluable opportunity to grow as a researcher as it will enable me to learn "how to ask good research questions". This experience will prepare me to pursue graduate school research in robotics. I am grateful to my mentors, the entire CMU RISS organization, and the sponsors for making this opportunity possible. I'm looking forward to a fantastic summer research experience!

									Hi! I am Eric Chen, a rising junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Harvey Mudd College. At Harvey Mudd, I lead a team of undergraduates to develop an autonomous underwater robot for the Robosub competition as the Vice President of Software, and I work as a machine learning research to investigate ways to quantitatively compare model assumptions, bias, and capacity with Mudd's AMISTAD Lab. I enjoy learning about all forms of perception (computer vision, deep learning, multisensor) and developing robot infrastructure. This summer, I am excited to work with Professor Sebastian Scherer and Cherie Ho in the Air Lab on an adaptive long-range perception system that predicts lidar labels using a camera for off-Road driving in the DARPA RACER competition. For this project, I aim to use the LIDAR to automatically label image data to train the model online. This self-supervised, online approach will allow our image segmentation model to adapt to the constantly changing environment of off-road driving. Working on this project allows me to contribute to the cutting edge of autonomous driving and will help me grow as a vision researcher. With my remaining time as a RISS Scholar, I hope to enrich my knowledge of robotics, meet experts in the field, and connect with the other students in my amazing cohort. I am grateful to the RISS staff, sponsors, and the AirLab team for providing me with this valuable experience.

									Mentor: John M. Dolan								

									Hello, my name is Caleb Chang and I am a rising senior studying Electrical Engineering at Georgia Tech. I am interested in controls, signal processing, and anything else robotics-related! This summer, I have the opportunity to dive deeper into the field of robotics–specifically in autonomous vehicle safety.  As part of RISS, I will be working under Dr. John M. Dolan at the Robotics Institute to tackle three primary goals regarding safety-critical control. The first is to develop a method to determine pairwise interactions between vehicles. The second is to estimate the parameters of a control barrier function from noisy observations. Third, by combining results from the first and second goals, we can develop an appropriate strategy for the ego agent to better interact with the target agent and its surrounding vehicles allowing for safer and more effective locomotion. I am super grateful to John M. Dolan, Yiwei Lyu, and those at the Robotics Institute for giving me this opportunity to work, learn, and grow to be a more mature researcher this summer.

									Mentor: Jack Mostow								

									Hello! I am Anisa Callis and I am a current mentee pursuing my passion for human-centered design majoring in Human-Centered Design and Development at Pennsylvania State University as a rising junior and a member of the Millennium Scholars Program, a highly selective program for underrepresented groups students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. I have and currently am engaged in active learning and developing skills in programming languages such as Java, Python, and R, and other tools used in my field such as Figma. I gained valuable experience with research last during my research experience for undergraduates (REU) at Rochester Institute of Technology. Through that opportunity, I learned how to conduct and run an experiment for the first time. My REU experience was virtual, presenting challenges that helped me grow in new ways. I learned to work in groups differently since all interaction was over zoom. I also found ways to connect and communicate with my groupmates through a screen and develop lasting relationships with my mentors. I ultimately wish to use last summer's REU and this summer's internship to gain experiences that will help me take my skills with human-centered design and software design into industry. I also have a desire to further my curiosities by gaining my Ph.D. in Human-centered design. My goal with my future career is  to use my experiences and degree to create technological solutions that are beneficial and not harmful to the targeted users while supporting others to do the same and find their enthusiasm for technology. Through Robotics Institute of Summer Scholars (RISS) working with Dr. Jack Mostow on his project RoboTutor, I wish to continue to gain confidence in my academic and research abilities, grow in my learned ability to work in teams, gain valuable mentorship and advice with long-lasting relationships, and experiences to further my future in Human-Centered Design.
