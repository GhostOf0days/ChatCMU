 Committee on Faculty Diversity, Inclusion and Development
To gain insight into the challenges and opportunities of diversity on the CMU campus, President Farnam Jahanian charged a faculty committee to advise him on how we might best recruit and retain a diverse, world-class faculty. The committeee is now broadening its scope to include work on enhancing faculty climate, promoting diversity and inclusion, and creating development opportunities.

Brian Kovak, Heinz College

This committee will help to maintain diversity as a foundational principle of CMU’s faculty infrastructure. One of their most important goals is to develop and disseminate tools and techniques that better enable colleges to recruit stellar faculty from a variety of backgrounds. In addition, the committee is tasked to create initiatives that enhance the retention and development of a diverse faculty; this is a critical element that will ensure our collegiate culture is rooted in inclusion.
College Diversity Liaisons
At the recommendation of the Committee, the deans have appointed Diversity Liaisons within each college to disseminate ideas and best pracrices throughout the university. Search committee chairs should contact their college's Diversity Liaison about processes to reduce implicit bias during searches. Faculty can also bring their ideas for fostering a more diverse faculty environment to their school or college Liaison(s).
