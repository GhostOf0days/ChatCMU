We can divide the development of the telegraph system into six phases, which
                        you can observe as you scroll down.In 1844, the federal government funded the first telegraph line in the United States to
                                see
                                whether Samuel Morse's telegraph invention worked. You will see this first line between
                                Washington and Baltimore. The
                                stations opened to the public the next year.
                            The experimental line worked, so in 1845 new telegraph companies built lines to connect
                                the
                                biggest cities in the Northeast. Watch these lines grow between 1845 and 1847. The
                                biggest
                                users of telegraphs were business people and newspapers, who clustered in big cities, so
                                it
                                made sense to build telegraphs to connect them.
                            The first telegraph connected New York to St. Louis, on the western border of the East,
                                in
                                1847. The next few years saw lines push south to New Orleans (the biggest market for
                                agricultural goods from the center of the country because products floated south on the
                                Mississippi River) and north to Canada. Watch lines and offices grow denser in
                                subsequent
                                years.
                            The first telegraphs on the Pacific Coast connected gold mining towns in the Sierra
                                Nevada to
                                the market cities of Sacramento and San Francisco. Watch the first lines appear east of
                                San
                                Francisco.
                            In the 1850s, six companies took over most of the telegraph networks in the East. In
                                1857, the six companies formed a cartel to help each company monopolize a different
                                region.
                            In the late 1850s, companies in California and Missouri built lines toward each other
                                along
                                two routes. One, called the Central Route, crossed the waist of the country. The other,
                                called the Southern Route, swung southward. You can see growth along both routes using
                                the
                                slider. For eighteen months, the Pony Express ferried telegrams between the Eastern and
                                California systems. In 1861, a gigantic push from both sides completed the
                                transcontinental
                                telegraph system on the Central Route. The Southern Route effort was put aside until
                                later.

                        collected so far, but it is not a complete map of all telegraph stations and lines. One of the biggest problems facing the United States in the nineteenth century was
                        uniting a
                        vast
                        nation. In 1800, the country hugged the Atlantic coast. By 1900, the country stretched
                        from
                        the
                        Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. American leaders feared that new states on the
                        Pacific
                        Coast would feel so far from the rest of the nation that they would try to form an
                        independent
                        nation.
                    To solve this problem, Americans placed their faith in two new technologies: telegraphs
                        and
                        steam
                        engines. But neither of these technologies united the nation overnight. It took decades
                        to
                        build
                        telegraphs and railroads that stretched from ocean to ocean and united all the states.
                    To help us understand the process of uniting the states, we built the first digital map
                        of a
                        telegraph system. We invite you to use the map to see for yourself how modern technology
                        helped
                        build
                        a

Uniting the States with Telegraphs, 1844-1862





















Development Phases
                    


We can divide the development of the telegraph system into six phases, which
                        you can observe as you scroll down.


Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1844-1845)
In 1844, the federal government funded the first telegraph line in the United States to
                                see
                                whether Samuel Morse's telegraph invention worked. You will see this first line between
                                Washington and Baltimore. The
                                stations opened to the public the next year.

Phase 2: Connecting Northeastern Cities (1845-1847)
The experimental line worked, so in 1845 new telegraph companies built lines to connect
                                the
                                biggest cities in the Northeast. Watch these lines grow between 1845 and 1847. The
                                biggest
                                users of telegraphs were business people and newspapers, who clustered in big cities, so
                                it
                                made sense to build telegraphs to connect them.

Phase 3: Unifying the East (1847-1854)
The first telegraph connected New York to St. Louis, on the western border of the East,
                                in
                                1847. The next few years saw lines push south to New Orleans (the biggest market for
                                agricultural goods from the center of the country because products floated south on the

Phase 4: Connecting Northern California (1852-1854)
The first telegraphs on the Pacific Coast connected gold mining towns in the Sierra
                                Nevada to
                                the market cities of Sacramento and San Francisco. Watch the first lines appear east of

Phase 5: Consolidation (1851-1857)
In the 1850s, six companies took over most of the telegraph networks in the East. In

Phase 6: Creating a Transcontinental System (1858-1862)
In the late 1850s, companies in California and Missouri built lines toward each other
                                along
                                two routes. One, called the Central Route, crossed the waist of the country. The other,
                                called the Southern Route, swung southward. You can see growth along both routes using
                                the

                                telegraph system on the Central Route. The Southern Route effort was put aside until
                                later.

                        (b) whether a line was part of a Pacific telegraph system (built by multiple companies), or (c)
                        the whole American telegraph system (all networks in black).

Some features of the map are tied to dates, so they will change as you adjust the time
                            slider. These features are telegraph networks (stations and lines), mail routes, Native
                            American cessions and reservations, and historic states and territories.

                            To show a mail route, the time slider must be within the dates the route operated. For
                            example, the Pony Express operated from April 1860 to October 1861. To see it, (a)
                            position the time slider within that range and (b) check Pony Express (letters and
                            telegrams) in the layer list in the lower right.

Development Phases
                    


We can divide the development of the telegraph system into six phases, which
                        you can observe as you scroll down.


Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1844-1845)
In 1844, the federal government funded the first telegraph line in the United States to
                                see
                                whether Samuel Morse's telegraph invention worked. You will see this first line between
                                Washington and Baltimore. The
                                stations opened to the public the next year.

Phase 2: Connecting Northeastern Cities (1845-1847)
The experimental line worked, so in 1845 new telegraph companies built lines to connect
                                the
                                biggest cities in the Northeast. Watch these lines grow between 1845 and 1847. The
                                biggest
                                users of telegraphs were business people and newspapers, who clustered in big cities, so
                                it
                                made sense to build telegraphs to connect them.

                                opened December 26, 1846
                            
âFigured in the War. The Old Provost Marshal's Offices and
                                Occupants
                                Recalled.,â Pittsburgh Dispatch, February 13, 1892.


Phase 3: Unifying the East (1847-1854)
The first telegraph connected New York to St. Louis, on the western border of the East,
                                in
                                1847. The next few years saw lines push south to New Orleans (the biggest market for
                                agricultural goods from the center of the country because products floated south on the
                                Mississippi River) and north to Canada. Watch lines and offices grow denser in
                                subsequent
                                years.

Phase 4: Connecting Northern California (1852-1854)
The first telegraphs on the Pacific Coast connected gold mining towns in the Sierra
                                Nevada to
                                the market cities of Sacramento and San Francisco. Watch the first lines appear east of

Phase 5: Consolidation (1851-1857)
In the 1850s, six companies took over most of the telegraph networks in the East. In
                                1857, the six companies formed a cartel to help each company monopolize a different
                                region.

Phase 6: Creating a Transcontinental System (1858-1862)
In the late 1850s, companies in California and Missouri built lines toward each other
                                along
                                two routes. One, called the Central Route, crossed the waist of the country. The other,
                                called the Southern Route, swung southward. You can see growth along both routes using
                                the
                                slider. For eighteen months, the Pony Express ferried telegrams between the Eastern and
                                California systems. In 1861, a gigantic push from both sides completed the
                                transcontinental
                                telegraph system on the Central Route. The Southern Route effort was put aside until
                                later.

Some features of the map are tied to dates, so they will change as you adjust the time
                            slider. These features are telegraph networks (stations and lines), mail routes, Native
                            American cessions and reservations, and historic states and territories.

                            To show a mail route, the time slider must be within the dates the route operated. For
                            example, the Pony Express operated from April 1860 to October 1861. To see it, (a)
                            position the time slider within that range and (b) check Pony Express (letters and
                            telegrams) in the layer list in the lower right.

Development Phases
                    


We can divide the development of the telegraph system into six phases, which
                        you can observe as you scroll down.


Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1844-1845)
In 1844, the federal government funded the first telegraph line in the United States to
                                see
                                whether Samuel Morse's telegraph invention worked. You will see this first line between
                                Washington and Baltimore. The
                                stations opened to the public the next year.

Phase 2: Connecting Northeastern Cities (1845-1847)
The experimental line worked, so in 1845 new telegraph companies built lines to connect
                                the
                                biggest cities in the Northeast. Watch these lines grow between 1845 and 1847. The
                                biggest
                                users of telegraphs were business people and newspapers, who clustered in big cities, so
                                it
                                made sense to build telegraphs to connect them.

Phase 3: Unifying the East (1847-1854)
The first telegraph connected New York to St. Louis, on the western border of the East,
                                in
                                1847. The next few years saw lines push south to New Orleans (the biggest market for
                                agricultural goods from the center of the country because products floated south on the
                                Mississippi River) and north to Canada. Watch lines and offices grow denser in
                                subsequent
                                years.

Phase 4: Connecting Northern California (1852-1854)
The first telegraphs on the Pacific Coast connected gold mining towns in the Sierra
                                Nevada to
                                the market cities of Sacramento and San Francisco. Watch the first lines appear east of

Phase 5: Consolidation (1851-1857)
In the 1850s, six companies took over most of the telegraph networks in the East. In
                                1857, the six companies formed a cartel to help each company monopolize a different
                                region.

Phase 6: Creating a Transcontinental System (1858-1862)
In the late 1850s, companies in California and Missouri built lines toward each other
                                along
                                two routes. One, called the Central Route, crossed the waist of the country. The other,
                                called the Southern Route, swung southward. You can see growth along both routes using
                                the
                                slider. For eighteen months, the Pony Express ferried telegrams between the Eastern and
                                California systems. In 1861, a gigantic push from both sides completed the
                                transcontinental
                                telegraph system on the Central Route. The Southern Route effort was put aside until
                                later.

We can divide the development of the telegraph system into six phases, which
                        you can observe as you scroll down.


Phase 1: Proof of Concept (1844-1845)
In 1844, the federal government funded the first telegraph line in the United States to
                                see
                                whether Samuel Morse's telegraph invention worked. You will see this first line between
                                Washington and Baltimore. The
                                stations opened to the public the next year.

Phase 2: Connecting Northeastern Cities (1845-1847)
The experimental line worked, so in 1845 new telegraph companies built lines to connect
                                the
                                biggest cities in the Northeast. Watch these lines grow between 1845 and 1847. The
                                biggest
                                users of telegraphs were business people and newspapers, who clustered in big cities, so
                                it
                                made sense to build telegraphs to connect them.

Phase 3: Unifying the East (1847-1854)
The first telegraph connected New York to St. Louis, on the western border of the East,
                                in
                                1847. The next few years saw lines push south to New Orleans (the biggest market for
                                agricultural goods from the center of the country because products floated south on the
                                Mississippi River) and north to Canada. Watch lines and offices grow denser in
                                subsequent
                                years.

Phase 4: Connecting Northern California (1852-1854)
The first telegraphs on the Pacific Coast connected gold mining towns in the Sierra
                                Nevada to
                                the market cities of Sacramento and San Francisco. Watch the first lines appear east of

Phase 5: Consolidation (1851-1857)
In the 1850s, six companies took over most of the telegraph networks in the East. In
                                1857, the six companies formed a cartel to help each company monopolize a different
                                region.

Phase 6: Creating a Transcontinental System (1858-1862)
In the late 1850s, companies in California and Missouri built lines toward each other
                                along
                                two routes. One, called the Central Route, crossed the waist of the country. The other,
                                called the Southern Route, swung southward. You can see growth along both routes using
                                the
                                slider. For eighteen months, the Pony Express ferried telegrams between the Eastern and
                                California systems. In 1861, a gigantic push from both sides completed the
                                transcontinental
                                telegraph system on the Central Route. The Southern Route effort was put aside until
                                later.

Uniting the States with Telegraphs, 1844-1862
Edmund Russell and Lauren Winkler


One of the biggest problems facing the United States in the nineteenth century was
                        uniting a
                        vast
                        nation. In 1800, the country hugged the Atlantic coast. By 1900, the country stretched
                        from
                        the
                        Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. American leaders feared that new states on the
                        Pacific
                        Coast would feel so far from the rest of the nation that they would try to form an
                        independent
                        nation.
                    
To solve this problem, Americans placed their faith in two new technologies: telegraphs
                        and
                        steam
                        engines. But neither of these technologies united the nation overnight. It took decades
                        to
                        build
                        telegraphs and railroads that stretched from ocean to ocean and united all the states.
                    
To help us understand the process of uniting the states, we built the first digital map
                        of a
                        telegraph system. We invite you to use the map to see for yourself how modern technology
                        helped
                        build
                        a
                        transcontinental nation.

Uniting the States with Telegraphs, 1844-1862
Edmund Russell and Lauren Winkler

One of the biggest problems facing the United States in the nineteenth century was
                        uniting a
                        vast
                        nation. In 1800, the country hugged the Atlantic coast. By 1900, the country stretched
                        from
                        the
                        Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. American leaders feared that new states on the
                        Pacific
                        Coast would feel so far from the rest of the nation that they would try to form an
                        independent
                        nation.
                    
To solve this problem, Americans placed their faith in two new technologies: telegraphs
                        and
                        steam
                        engines. But neither of these technologies united the nation overnight. It took decades
                        to
                        build
                        telegraphs and railroads that stretched from ocean to ocean and united all the states.
                    
To help us understand the process of uniting the states, we built the first digital map
                        of a
                        telegraph system. We invite you to use the map to see for yourself how modern technology
                        helped
                        build
                        a
                        transcontinental nation.
