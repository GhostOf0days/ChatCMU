Teaching & Learning










Creating a meaningful classroom and learning experience for students is central for Carnegie Mellon.
To engage our bright and inquisitive students, we have to explore and adopt the latest in learning engineering and educational tools and create resources for faculty to use them.
Through the work of the Simon Initiative and other programs, CMU is a leader the next generation of technology for education, and providing educational tools and methods for CMU and to the broader education community.
Support CMU’s work to provide the resources for our faculty to excel in their roles as educators.












 

You can
advance educational
initiatives through:

Faculty Support: Enrich our pioneering educators with educational and research tools through the Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence and Educational Innovation.
Seed Grants: Engage educators with resources to support projects that will enhance learning and create opportunities for faculty to pursue research, teaching and technology-enhanced learning opportunities.
CS Academy: Fuel the next generation of computer scientists through this high school interactive computer science curriculum. Dynamic learning tools and teacher support create learning opportunities at an early age and prepare pre-college students with the fundamentals of computer science.
Summer Academy for Math and Science (SAMS): Strengthen student commitment to pursuing STEM-related disciplines with opportunities for students from underrepresented communities to explore these fields while earning college credit.















Through the work of the Simon Initiative, faculty have access to a cross-disciplinary learning engineering ecosystem that has developed over several decades at Carnegie Mellon with the goal to measurably improve student learning outcomes.
CMU is providing accessible tools and methods that educators and institutions around the world can adopt to advance learning on a global scale.
