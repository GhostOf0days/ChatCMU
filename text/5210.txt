Major Minor



BXA: Computer Science and Arts
Created by the College of Fine Arts and the School of Computer Science, this program gives students an ideal technical and artistic foundation so they can pursue fields that blur the lines between technology and the arts, like game design, computer animation, robotic art and more.

Major



Computational Biology
Students will gain significant knowledge in the fundamentals of computer science while building a strong background in biology. Most importantly, the program emphasizes integrating knowledge so students can make connections between the two fields.

Major Minor



Computer Science
Computing is a discipline with strong links to many fields, and this program gives students unparalleled flexibility to pursue these fields and provides the formal tools to remain current as technologies and systems change.

Major Minor



Human-Computer Interaction
Students in this program develop a strong background in the fundamentals of computer science, as well a unique perspective on how digital products and services impact humans.

Major Minor



Information Security, Privacy and Policy
Offered by the Department of Engineering and Public Policy in partnership with the School of Computer Science, this minor provides students from all majors with an understanding of security topics and relevant legal and policy issues.

Minor



Language Technologies
Human language technologies have become an increasingly central component of computer science. The minor gives students the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.

Minor



Machine Learning
Machine learning and statistical methods are increasingly used in many application areas including natural language processing, speech, vision, robotics and computational biology. This program teaches undergraduates the core principles of the field.

Minor



Neural Computation
Neural Computation aims to understand the neural basis of intelligent behaviors from a computational perspective. This minor provides students with both the basic computational skills and cognitive science and neuroscience knowledge that are central to the field.

Human language technologies have become an increasingly central component of computer science. The minor gives students the opportunity to not only learn about language technologies, but to also apply that knowledge through a directed project.

Minor



Machine Learning
Machine learning and statistical methods are increasingly used in many application areas including natural language processing, speech, vision, robotics and computational biology. This program teaches undergraduates the core principles of the field.

Minor



Neural Computation
Neural Computation aims to understand the neural basis of intelligent behaviors from a computational perspective. This minor provides students with both the basic computational skills and cognitive science and neuroscience knowledge that are central to the field.

Minor



Robotics
Students receive a background in engineering and computer science, while also receiving hands-on experience with motion, control and systems unique to robotics. They learn the principles and practices of robotics through theoretical studies and hands-on experience with a robotics minor.

Major Minor



Software Engineering
Students with this minor learn the fundamental tools, techniques and processes of software engineering. The core curriculum includes material on both engineering the software product and the process, teamwork and management skills essential to successful engineering.

Minor



Statistics and Machine Learning
The Statistics and Machine Learning major provides students with the tools needed to analyze and interpret real-world data that exhibit random variation, with added focus on computer science and machine-based analysis algorithms.
