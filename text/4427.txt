As stewards of the Carnegie Mellon University brand, our experienced graphic designers will help you achieve that reaction while representing CMU to the highest standards.Designers don’t do it alone, though. Each design project is assigned a project manager. Project managers work hand-and-hand with designers to ensure that design projects are executed on-time and on-budget.
