Frequently Asked Questions

How much spending money will I need?
On average, students can spend anywhere from $250-$350 during a six-week stay. This is dependent on what students want to purchase. Nineteen meals per week are covered through the dining plan, but students will need spending money if they choose to eat off-campus. Students may also wish to purchase souvenirs at the bookstore or in nearby shopping areas.
Spending money is not required. However, if students choose to make purchases, they may want to bring spending money.
Typically, the best way to get cash to students is by sending them with an ATM card. There are PNC Bank and Citizens Bank ATMS conveniently located in Carnegie Mellon’s Cohon University Center.
Please Note: It is highly recommended that students do not bring large sums of cash. If students do have cash, we recommend that they always keep it with them or keep in under lock and key.Will I have any other expenses while at Pre-College?
Typical additional expenses may include:

Any medical expenses not covered by insurance either from University Health Services or outside medical facilities
Library fines for late or lost items
Off-campus trip tickets
Any school supplies that are not covered as part of the program cost
Transportation from your home to campus and back
Private music lessons

Frequently Asked Questions

How much spending money will I need?
On average, students can spend anywhere from $250-$350 during a six-week stay. This is dependent on what students want to purchase. Nineteen meals per week are covered through the dining plan, but students will need spending money if they choose to eat off-campus. Students may also wish to purchase souvenirs at the bookstore or in nearby shopping areas.
Spending money is not required. However, if students choose to make purchases, they may want to bring spending money.
Typically, the best way to get cash to students is by sending them with an ATM card. There are PNC Bank and Citizens Bank ATMS conveniently located in Carnegie Mellon’s Cohon University Center.
Please Note: It is highly recommended that students do not bring large sums of cash. If students do have cash, we recommend that they always keep it with them or keep in under lock and key.Will I have any other expenses while at Pre-College?
Typical additional expenses may include:

Any medical expenses not covered by insurance either from University Health Services or outside medical facilities
Library fines for late or lost items
Off-campus trip tickets
Any school supplies that are not covered as part of the program cost
Transportation from your home to campus and back
Private music lessons
