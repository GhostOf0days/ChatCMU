Ideally, all undergraduates should complete their First-Year Writing requirement during their first year at Carnegie Mellon. If you identify English as a second or somewhat weaker language, the English Department may advise that you take 76-100, Reading and Writing in an Academic Context as a pre-requisite experience to ensure a successful first-year writing experience. Multilingualstudents who indicated that English is not their primary or native language, will receive an email in late May or early June, notifying them to complete the informed self-placement process to decide which First-Year Writing course is best for them.Students should engage with this informed self-placement process if any of these statements sound true to you:If students meet any of the following qualifications, they are not required to complete the informed self-placement process and can apply for exemption::During the summer months and before fall registration, students can apply for an exemption through a form in Canvas. You can view the placement process in Canvas and take a “quiz” for immediate exemption from the process, as relevant. You can locate the exemption quiz here https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/35117 The exam will be available from early June until late July. Please check with your academic advisor for your college's placement deadline. Some colleges require students to complete the placement exam earlier than the final First-Year Writing deadline of August 1st. If you have not yet received a message from a college or academic advisor, click here for information about what to expect: https://www.cmu.edu/first-year-orientation/preparing-for-cmu/course-registration.html Students who take the exam by 11:59 PM EDT on June 29th should receive their course placement by July 7th. Students who take the exam by 11:59 PM EDT on July 31st should receive their course placement recommendation by August 3rd.

 First-Year Writing Placement
The Writing & Communication Program in English maintains  placement processes for first-year students who identify particular kinds of needs. First year students who identify English as a second and/or weaker language need to complete an informed self-placement process, which you can learn about below.
Students who identify as advanced in writing and can demonstrate facility across a broad range of academic genres can apply to enroll in 76102, Advanced First-Year Writing, which you can learn about below.
Informed Self-Placement Process for Multilingual Students
Ideally, all undergraduates should complete their First-Year Writing requirement during their first year at Carnegie Mellon. If you identify English as a second or somewhat weaker language, the English Department may advise that you take 76-100, Reading and Writing in an Academic Context as a pre-requisite experience to ensure a successful first-year writing experience. Multilingualstudents who indicated that English is not their primary or native language, will receive an email in late May or early June, notifying them to complete the informed self-placement process to decide which First-Year Writing course is best for them.
Students should engage with this informed self-placement process if any of these statements sound true to you:

You identify as multilingual, and English is somewhat weaker than a first language
You identify as multilingual—your English is as strong as another language but typically used in school only
You identified English as a second language on your college admissions application 

Informed Self-Placement Process Exemption Criteria
If students meet any of the following qualifications, they are not required to complete the informed self-placement process and can apply for exemption::

Received a 5 on the AP English Language and Composition OR Literature and Composition Exam
Received a 7 on the IB English A Exam
Received an A on Cambridge International A or AS level exams in English Language, Literature in English, OR Language and Literature in English
Attended all four years of high school (9th-12th grade) in the US, Canada, or the UK

During the summer months and before fall registration, students can apply for an exemption through a form in Canvas. You can view the placement process in Canvas and take a “quiz” for immediate exemption from the process, as relevant. You can locate the exemption quiz here https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/35117 
The exam will be available from early June until late July. Please check with your academic advisor for your college's placement deadline. Some colleges require students to complete the placement exam earlier than the final First-Year Writing deadline of August 1st. If you have not yet received a message from a college or academic advisor, click here for information about what to expect: https://www.cmu.edu/first-year-orientation/preparing-for-cmu/course-registration.html 
Students who take the exam by 11:59 PM EDT on June 29th should receive their course placement by July 7th. Students who take the exam by 11:59 PM EDT on July 31st should receive their course placement recommendation by August 3rd. Any exam received after July 31st will be scored by August 28th.
The exam is located on CMU's Canvas site. To access it, please complete the following steps:

Go to http://www.cmu.edu/canvas/.
Enter CMU Andrew ID and password.
The exam should be listed under "Courses" as "First-Year Writing Placement Exam 2023" Click on this course link and follow the instructions to begin the exam.

Please note: The assessment must be completed within 96 hours (4 days) after it is started. Students may read the instructions and complete Step 1 before this time begins, but they should only plan to begin Steps 2 and 3 of the exam when there is enough time to finish them within this timeframe.
If students have problems with Carnegie Mellon's Canvas site, please e-mail canvas-help@andrew.cmu.edu. For other questions or problems with the online exam, please email us at engfirst@andrew.cmu.  
Application Process for Advanced Writing, 76102
For students who demonstrate advanced writing skills as a first-year student, the Writing & Communication Program in English also offers  a  full-semester course, 76-102: Advanced First-Year Writing. Students seeking to enroll in this advanced course must participate in an application process during the summer. This year's process is now open. Click here for the application.
Credit for AP and IB Courses
All first-year students must fulfill the First-Year Writing requirement by enrolling in one of two full-semester courses (76-101 or 76-102) or two of three half-semester mini courses (76-106, 76-107, or 76-108). Carnegie Mellon University does not accept any Advanced Placement (AP) score in place of this requirement.
Students who score a 5 on an AP English exam can receive9 credits of elective English credit. Students should speak with their advisor for more information. Transfer students who have been granted AP credit from another institution should consult with their advisor. 
Please direct any questions on AP or IB transfer credit to Dr. Amy Stoebe, Assistant Director of the Writing & Communication Program.

 First-Year Writing Placement
The Writing & Communication Program in English maintains  placement processes for first-year students who identify particular kinds of needs. First year students who identify English as a second and/or weaker language need to complete an informed self-placement process, which you can learn about below.
Students who identify as advanced in writing and can demonstrate facility across a broad range of academic genres can apply to enroll in 76102, Advanced First-Year Writing, which you can learn about below.
Informed Self-Placement Process for Multilingual Students
Ideally, all undergraduates should complete their First-Year Writing requirement during their first year at Carnegie Mellon. If you identify English as a second or somewhat weaker language, the English Department may advise that you take 76-100, Reading and Writing in an Academic Context as a pre-requisite experience to ensure a successful first-year writing experience. Multilingualstudents who indicated that English is not their primary or native language, will receive an email in late May or early June, notifying them to complete the informed self-placement process to decide which First-Year Writing course is best for them.
Students should engage with this informed self-placement process if any of these statements sound true to you:

You identify as multilingual, and English is somewhat weaker than a first language
You identify as multilingual—your English is as strong as another language but typically used in school only
You identified English as a second language on your college admissions application 

Informed Self-Placement Process Exemption Criteria
If students meet any of the following qualifications, they are not required to complete the informed self-placement process and can apply for exemption::

Received a 5 on the AP English Language and Composition OR Literature and Composition Exam
Received a 7 on the IB English A Exam
Received an A on Cambridge International A or AS level exams in English Language, Literature in English, OR Language and Literature in English
Attended all four years of high school (9th-12th grade) in the US, Canada, or the UK

During the summer months and before fall registration, students can apply for an exemption through a form in Canvas. You can view the placement process in Canvas and take a “quiz” for immediate exemption from the process, as relevant. You can locate the exemption quiz here https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/35117 
The exam will be available from early June until late July. Please check with your academic advisor for your college's placement deadline. Some colleges require students to complete the placement exam earlier than the final First-Year Writing deadline of August 1st. If you have not yet received a message from a college or academic advisor, click here for information about what to expect: https://www.cmu.edu/first-year-orientation/preparing-for-cmu/course-registration.html 
Students who take the exam by 11:59 PM EDT on June 29th should receive their course placement by July 7th. Students who take the exam by 11:59 PM EDT on July 31st should receive their course placement recommendation by August 3rd. Any exam received after July 31st will be scored by August 28th.
The exam is located on CMU's Canvas site. To access it, please complete the following steps:

Go to http://www.cmu.edu/canvas/.
Enter CMU Andrew ID and password.
The exam should be listed under "Courses" as "First-Year Writing Placement Exam 2023" Click on this course link and follow the instructions to begin the exam.

Please note: The assessment must be completed within 96 hours (4 days) after it is started. Students may read the instructions and complete Step 1 before this time begins, but they should only plan to begin Steps 2 and 3 of the exam when there is enough time to finish them within this timeframe.
If students have problems with Carnegie Mellon's Canvas site, please e-mail canvas-help@andrew.cmu.edu. For other questions or problems with the online exam, please email us at engfirst@andrew.cmu.  
Application Process for Advanced Writing, 76102
For students who demonstrate advanced writing skills as a first-year student, the Writing & Communication Program in English also offers  a  full-semester course, 76-102: Advanced First-Year Writing. Students seeking to enroll in this advanced course must participate in an application process during the summer. This year's process is now open. Click here for the application.
Credit for AP and IB Courses
All first-year students must fulfill the First-Year Writing requirement by enrolling in one of two full-semester courses (76-101 or 76-102) or two of three half-semester mini courses (76-106, 76-107, or 76-108). Carnegie Mellon University does not accept any Advanced Placement (AP) score in place of this requirement.
Students who score a 5 on an AP English exam can receive9 credits of elective English credit. Students should speak with their advisor for more information. Transfer students who have been granted AP credit from another institution should consult with their advisor. 
Please direct any questions on AP or IB transfer credit to Dr. Amy Stoebe, Assistant Director of the Writing & Communication Program.

 First-Year Writing Placement
The Writing & Communication Program in English maintains  placement processes for first-year students who identify particular kinds of needs. First year students who identify English as a second and/or weaker language need to complete an informed self-placement process, which you can learn about below.
Students who identify as advanced in writing and can demonstrate facility across a broad range of academic genres can apply to enroll in 76102, Advanced First-Year Writing, which you can learn about below.
Informed Self-Placement Process for Multilingual Students
Ideally, all undergraduates should complete their First-Year Writing requirement during their first year at Carnegie Mellon. If you identify English as a second or somewhat weaker language, the English Department may advise that you take 76-100, Reading and Writing in an Academic Context as a pre-requisite experience to ensure a successful first-year writing experience. Multilingualstudents who indicated that English is not their primary or native language, will receive an email in late May or early June, notifying them to complete the informed self-placement process to decide which First-Year Writing course is best for them.
Students should engage with this informed self-placement process if any of these statements sound true to you:

You identify as multilingual, and English is somewhat weaker than a first language
You identify as multilingual—your English is as strong as another language but typically used in school only
You identified English as a second language on your college admissions application 

Informed Self-Placement Process Exemption Criteria
If students meet any of the following qualifications, they are not required to complete the informed self-placement process and can apply for exemption::

Received a 5 on the AP English Language and Composition OR Literature and Composition Exam
Received a 7 on the IB English A Exam
Received an A on Cambridge International A or AS level exams in English Language, Literature in English, OR Language and Literature in English
Attended all four years of high school (9th-12th grade) in the US, Canada, or the UK

During the summer months and before fall registration, students can apply for an exemption through a form in Canvas. You can view the placement process in Canvas and take a “quiz” for immediate exemption from the process, as relevant. You can locate the exemption quiz here https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/35117 
The exam will be available from early June until late July. Please check with your academic advisor for your college's placement deadline. Some colleges require students to complete the placement exam earlier than the final First-Year Writing deadline of August 1st. If you have not yet received a message from a college or academic advisor, click here for information about what to expect: https://www.cmu.edu/first-year-orientation/preparing-for-cmu/course-registration.html 
Students who take the exam by 11:59 PM EDT on June 29th should receive their course placement by July 7th. Students who take the exam by 11:59 PM EDT on July 31st should receive their course placement recommendation by August 3rd. Any exam received after July 31st will be scored by August 28th.
The exam is located on CMU's Canvas site. To access it, please complete the following steps:

Go to http://www.cmu.edu/canvas/.
Enter CMU Andrew ID and password.
The exam should be listed under "Courses" as "First-Year Writing Placement Exam 2023" Click on this course link and follow the instructions to begin the exam.

Please note: The assessment must be completed within 96 hours (4 days) after it is started. Students may read the instructions and complete Step 1 before this time begins, but they should only plan to begin Steps 2 and 3 of the exam when there is enough time to finish them within this timeframe.
If students have problems with Carnegie Mellon's Canvas site, please e-mail canvas-help@andrew.cmu.edu. For other questions or problems with the online exam, please email us at engfirst@andrew.cmu.  
Application Process for Advanced Writing, 76102
For students who demonstrate advanced writing skills as a first-year student, the Writing & Communication Program in English also offers  a  full-semester course, 76-102: Advanced First-Year Writing. Students seeking to enroll in this advanced course must participate in an application process during the summer. This year's process is now open. Click here for the application.
Credit for AP and IB Courses
All first-year students must fulfill the First-Year Writing requirement by enrolling in one of two full-semester courses (76-101 or 76-102) or two of three half-semester mini courses (76-106, 76-107, or 76-108). Carnegie Mellon University does not accept any Advanced Placement (AP) score in place of this requirement.
Students who score a 5 on an AP English exam can receive9 credits of elective English credit. Students should speak with their advisor for more information. Transfer students who have been granted AP credit from another institution should consult with their advisor. 
Please direct any questions on AP or IB transfer credit to Dr. Amy Stoebe, Assistant Director of the Writing & Communication Program.
