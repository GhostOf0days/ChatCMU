 Tarasha Khurana 

			I am a Ph.D. student at The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University advised by Prof. Deva Ramanan. My research focus is broadly on spatiotemporal 3D scene understanding. Previously, during my Masters at CMU RI, I worked on estimating and exploiting 3D scene geometry from single images, to reason about occlusions and densify sparse depth input.

			I hold a B.E. degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Delhi and have had the fortune to work at amazing companies - Google Research, Argo AI, Staqu Technologies.
