 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
How do I register a new CMU UAS/Drone?

The owner of the UAS/Drone shall complete the registration form found on the UAS/Drone Portal. The UAS/Drone CMU registration form is intended for registering UAS/Drone purchased with CMU funding and is then owned by the university. This registration process ensures the CMU owned UAS/Drones are registered through the FAA under the CMU UAS/Drone account.

How do I start a new flight request?

At least 2 business days before the flight, the faculty, staff, or student who would like to fly a UAS/Drone over University Property should fill out the Flight Operations Request Form found on the UAS Portal. The form is submitted to EHS who will verify the UAS/Drone registration, Pilot training, insurance coverage, and applicable contracts. The flight operations request will be routed to the space owners and the committee for comments and feedback. Once approved, the requester will receive notice of the approval.

My lab purchased a UAS/Drone with CMU funding. What steps do I need to take so my team can fly the UAS/drone?

Before flying a CMU owned UAS/Drone, the following steps need to be completed:

Register the drone through the UAS/Drone Registration Process
Those wishing to fly the drone will need to complete the following trainings before conducting unsupervised UAS/Drone flights:

FAA Remote Pilot Certificate as noted in the FAA's Small UAS/Drone Rule for outdoor flights (Part 107) (this training is not required when operating the UAS indoors).
FAA Trust Training for flights occurring indoors.
CMU-Sponsored Training regardless of the flight location.


The UAS/Drone Pilot needs to complete a Flight Operation Request prior to operating a UAS/Drone over University Property.
A Flight Operation Closure Form once the flight has been completed.


Do I need approval to fly my personal UAS/Drone on campus?

Yes, CMU has developed the UAS/Drone Program to ensure drones used for academic, research business and recreation comply with applicable laws, mitigate safety risks, and protect the security and privacy of the CMU community.

I want to fly a CMU owned UAS/Drone indoors. What steps do I need to take?

                Indoor UAS/Drone flights on University Property shall only be conducted in approved
spaces. Space owners who wish to create an indoor flight space shall complete a New Indoor Flight Space request form for initial approval from the UAS/Drone Committee. New and approved indoor flight spaces shall be inspected by EHS annually to ensure minimum requirements are met. EHS will track approved indoor flight spaces.

Who can fly a UAS/Drone on campus?

Faculty, staff, students, and approved vendors acting on behalf of the university can fly a UAS/Drone on CMU property once they have successfully completed the FAA and CMU registration process, FAA Pilot requirements, UAS/Drone Flight Approval Request Form, and minimum training requirements.

What training do UAS/Drone pilots need to have before flying a drone?

UAS/Drone Pilots conducting flight operations shall have the following trainings before conducting unsupervised UAS/Drone flights:

FAA Remote Pilot Certificate as noted in the FAA's Small UAS Rule for outdoor flights (Part 107) (this training is not required when operating the UAS/Drone indoors).
FAA Trust Training for flights occurring indoors.
CMU-Sponsored Training regardless of the flight location.


How do I report damage to a CMU UAS/Drone or CMU property?

Any incident that results in injury or property damage must be reported to the University immediately by emailing drones@andrew.cmu.edu. Any incident or injury that is considered an emergency must be reported to University Police immediately. Damages and/or injuries occurring to University Property or individuals will be the responsibility of the UAS operator. Any incident resulting in serious injury, loss of consciousness, or property damage greater than $500 must be reported to the FAA within 10 calendar days.

I received approval for my flight request but must reschedule. Do I need to open a new request form when I want to fly again?

If changes to the approved flight request occur, the UAS/Drone Pilot will need to complete the Flight Operation Change Form. In addition, if an approved flight is canceled, a Cancellation Form needs to be completed.

Does the UAS/Drone Program cover drones over 55 pounds?

No, UAS/Drones that are over 55 lbs are not included in the scope of the UAS/Drone program and must instead adhere to the applicable FAA rules. Contact drones@andrew.cmu.edu  for additional assistance.

The form is submitted to EHS who will verify the UAS/Drone registration, Pilot training, insurance coverage, and applicable contracts. The flight operations request will be routed to the space owners and the committee for comments and feedback. Once approved, the requester will receive notice of the approval.

My lab purchased a UAS/Drone with CMU funding. What steps do I need to take so my team can fly the UAS/drone?

Before flying a CMU owned UAS/Drone, the following steps need to be completed:

Register the drone through the UAS/Drone Registration Process
Those wishing to fly the drone will need to complete the following trainings before conducting unsupervised UAS/Drone flights:

FAA Remote Pilot Certificate as noted in the FAA's Small UAS/Drone Rule for outdoor flights (Part 107) (this training is not required when operating the UAS indoors).
FAA Trust Training for flights occurring indoors.
CMU-Sponsored Training regardless of the flight location.


The UAS/Drone Pilot needs to complete a Flight Operation Request prior to operating a UAS/Drone over University Property.
A Flight Operation Closure Form once the flight has been completed.


Do I need approval to fly my personal UAS/Drone on campus?

Yes, CMU has developed the UAS/Drone Program to ensure drones used for academic, research business and recreation comply with applicable laws, mitigate safety risks, and protect the security and privacy of the CMU community.

I want to fly a CMU owned UAS/Drone indoors. What steps do I need to take?

                Indoor UAS/Drone flights on University Property shall only be conducted in approved
spaces. Space owners who wish to create an indoor flight space shall complete a New Indoor Flight Space request form for initial approval from the UAS/Drone Committee. New and approved indoor flight spaces shall be inspected by EHS annually to ensure minimum requirements are met. EHS will track approved indoor flight spaces.

Who can fly a UAS/Drone on campus?

Faculty, staff, students, and approved vendors acting on behalf of the university can fly a UAS/Drone on CMU property once they have successfully completed the FAA and CMU registration process, FAA Pilot requirements, UAS/Drone Flight Approval Request Form, and minimum training requirements.

What training do UAS/Drone pilots need to have before flying a drone?

UAS/Drone Pilots conducting flight operations shall have the following trainings before conducting unsupervised UAS/Drone flights:

FAA Remote Pilot Certificate as noted in the FAA's Small UAS Rule for outdoor flights (Part 107) (this training is not required when operating the UAS/Drone indoors).
FAA Trust Training for flights occurring indoors.
CMU-Sponsored Training regardless of the flight location.


How do I report damage to a CMU UAS/Drone or CMU property?

Any incident that results in injury or property damage must be reported to the University immediately by emailing drones@andrew.cmu.edu. Any incident or injury that is considered an emergency must be reported to University Police immediately. Damages and/or injuries occurring to University Property or individuals will be the responsibility of the UAS operator. Any incident resulting in serious injury, loss of consciousness, or property damage greater than $500 must be reported to the FAA within 10 calendar days.

I received approval for my flight request but must reschedule. Do I need to open a new request form when I want to fly again?

If changes to the approved flight request occur, the UAS/Drone Pilot will need to complete the Flight Operation Change Form. In addition, if an approved flight is canceled, a Cancellation Form needs to be completed.

Does the UAS/Drone Program cover drones over 55 pounds?

No, UAS/Drones that are over 55 lbs are not included in the scope of the UAS/Drone program and must instead adhere to the applicable FAA rules. Contact drones@andrew.cmu.edu  for additional assistance.
