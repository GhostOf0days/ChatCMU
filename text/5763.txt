These themes organize the work, along with the experiments inspired by a spirit of formal and technological innovation at the school.The School of Architecture gratefully acknowledges our 2022 sponsors who have helped make this project possible: PERKINS EASTMAN, Strada | Design With People In Mind®, PWWG Architects, Sota Construction Services, Inc., Desmone Architects, GBBN, and Akhil Badjatia.The 2021 EX-CHANGE celebrates the 2020-21 work of the School of Architecture from first year to PhD through a video game, mixed-reality installation, exhibition, and catalog designed by Leah Wulfman (B.Arch '16) and Studio Elana Schlenker.

Thanks to our 2021 sponsors, Desmone Architects and GBBN!The 2020 EX-CHANGE exhibition and publication celebrates the 2019-20 work of the School of Architecture from first year to PhD. The first ever virtual EX-CHANGE exhibition was held from September 4-13, 2020 and featured a series of live events. The 2020 publication includes student work from the studios, research labs, and centers. In 2019, EX-CHANGE became a year-end exhibition, and for the first time celebrated the entire academic year of work from first year to PhD. The 2019 publication is a compendium of thought, work, and discussion generated by the spring 2019 EX-CHANGE exhibition and includes student work from the studios, research labs, and centers. The 2018 edition of the EX-CHANGE publication is a compendium of thought, work, and discussion generated by the EX-CHANGE exhibition. It includes student work from the studios, research labs, and centers alongside excerpts from the moderated conversation between students and critics Amy Kulper, Ming Fung, and Mitch McEwen based on questions generated by the studios. Inaugurated in the fall of 2017, EX-CHANGE represents an ongoing opportunity to shine new light on the School of Architecture’s programs and to position the work within larger questions of research and practice. The school’s studios generated rich provocations, collaborations, and opportunities for both orchestrated and spontaneous exchange. Beyond definitive answers, the projects and research of the studios grapple with an array of critical questions. These questions drove the inaugural end-of-semester exhibition and discussion with faculty, students, and invited guests Aaron Betsky and Trey Trahan.Carnegie Mellon Architecture, 5000 Forbes Avenue, College of Fine Arts 201, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 | 412.268.2354Statement of Assurance | Legal Info | Contact Us | Careers | Donate Copyright ©  Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture | All Rights Reserved

EX-CHANGECelebrating our Work





EX-CHANGE is the School of Architecture’s annual exhibition and publication celebrating student work from first year to PhD. Inaugurated in 2017, EX-CHANGE represents an ongoing opportunity to shine new light on the school’s programs and to position the work within larger questions of research and practice.

The 2023 EX-CHANGE exhibitions will be on view in the Great Hall of the College of Fine Arts and throughout the school from August 28–September 10, 2023. The book will launch with a celebration on Friday September 8, 5–8pm in Kresge Theatre, and will be available as part of a School of Architecture display at the inaugural Pittsburgh Art Book Fair September 9–10, 2023 at the Carnegie Museum of Art.

2017 EX-CHANGE Inaugurated in the fall of 2017, EX-CHANGE represents an ongoing opportunity to shine new light on the School of Architecture’s programs and to position the work within larger questions of research and practice. The school’s studios generated rich provocations, collaborations, and opportunities for both orchestrated and spontaneous exchange. Beyond definitive answers, the projects and research of the studios grapple with an array of critical questions. These questions drove the inaugural end-of-semester exhibition and discussion with faculty, students, and invited guests Aaron Betsky and Trey Trahan.

2017 EX-CHANGE Inaugurated in the fall of 2017, EX-CHANGE represents an ongoing opportunity to shine new light on the School of Architecture’s programs and to position the work within larger questions of research and practice. The school’s studios generated rich provocations, collaborations, and opportunities for both orchestrated and spontaneous exchange. Beyond definitive answers, the projects and research of the studios grapple with an array of critical questions. These questions drove the inaugural end-of-semester exhibition and discussion with faculty, students, and invited guests Aaron Betsky and Trey Trahan.

2017 EX-CHANGE Inaugurated in the fall of 2017, EX-CHANGE represents an ongoing opportunity to shine new light on the School of Architecture’s programs and to position the work within larger questions of research and practice. The school’s studios generated rich provocations, collaborations, and opportunities for both orchestrated and spontaneous exchange. Beyond definitive answers, the projects and research of the studios grapple with an array of critical questions. These questions drove the inaugural end-of-semester exhibition and discussion with faculty, students, and invited guests Aaron Betsky and Trey Trahan.

2017 EX-CHANGE Inaugurated in the fall of 2017, EX-CHANGE represents an ongoing opportunity to shine new light on the School of Architecture’s programs and to position the work within larger questions of research and practice. The school’s studios generated rich provocations, collaborations, and opportunities for both orchestrated and spontaneous exchange. Beyond definitive answers, the projects and research of the studios grapple with an array of critical questions. These questions drove the inaugural end-of-semester exhibition and discussion with faculty, students, and invited guests Aaron Betsky and Trey Trahan.
