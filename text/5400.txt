 Admissions
The MSCF program has an unrivaled reputation in the quantitative finance industry. Our brand was built over the past 25 years by our 1,850+ alumni, many of whom are top performers on Wall Street and beyond. Will you become part of this legacy?
If you have a strong background in mathematics and statistics with a facility in programming, MSCF could be your path to a highly rewarding career in quantitative finance.
Academics are the foundation of the admissions process, but candidates also need to have strong written and oral communication skills and the ability to work effectively in teams. Another important requirement is a keen interest in the financial markets and being able to articulate your quant finance career goals.
The MSCF admissions process is holistic in nature. While the class profile can serve as a guideline, we take a personalized approach to your qualifications and career interests. We will review all components of your application and any one area of weakness may be balanced by another area of strength. 
If you are admitted to the program, we will automatically consider you for a Merit Scholarship that can help in lowering your tuition cost. Merit Scholarships are based on your qualifications relative to the overall MSCF applicant pool.
Admissions prerequisites


Calculus I and II
Linear algebra
Calculus-based probability

A minimum of one-semester of an object-oriented programming language course (C++, Java, Python, C#). More than one semester is preferred.


Candidates with deficiency in one of these areas will be considered provided proper remediation is completed before enrollment, should an offer of admission be extended.

 Admissions
The MSCF program has an unrivaled reputation in the quantitative finance industry. Our brand was built over the past 25 years by our 1,850+ alumni, many of whom are top performers on Wall Street and beyond. Will you become part of this legacy?
If you have a strong background in mathematics and statistics with a facility in programming, MSCF could be your path to a highly rewarding career in quantitative finance.
Academics are the foundation of the admissions process, but candidates also need to have strong written and oral communication skills and the ability to work effectively in teams. Another important requirement is a keen interest in the financial markets and being able to articulate your quant finance career goals.
The MSCF admissions process is holistic in nature. While the class profile can serve as a guideline, we take a personalized approach to your qualifications and career interests. We will review all components of your application and any one area of weakness may be balanced by another area of strength. 
If you are admitted to the program, we will automatically consider you for a Merit Scholarship that can help in lowering your tuition cost. Merit Scholarships are based on your qualifications relative to the overall MSCF applicant pool.
Admissions prerequisites


Calculus I and II
Linear algebra
Calculus-based probability

A minimum of one-semester of an object-oriented programming language course (C++, Java, Python, C#). More than one semester is preferred.


Candidates with deficiency in one of these areas will be considered provided proper remediation is completed before enrollment, should an offer of admission be extended.
