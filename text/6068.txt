                                                  ›              Design for Learning
                            


 Design for Learning
Students in the Design for Learning minor, offered by the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), combine skills to imagine, design, iterate, and evaluate effective new media systems for learning—from creating games for learning to integrating adaptive ed-tech and augmented reality experiences into diverse learning settings. In team-based collaborations, students focus on the critical design of learning platforms, products, and systems that leverage emerging technologies, learning science research, inclusive design, and data analytics to create engaging educational experiences with measurable real-world impact.
Students in Design for Learning courses can bring media-making and prototyping competencies gained in other IDeATe areas (e.g. Game Design, Media Design, Physical Computing, Immersive Technologies in Arts & Humanities) to craft innovative learning experiences.
Through coursework in the minor, you will gain skills and competencies in: 

Learning design research and evaluation methods 
Concept modeling and prototyping techniques 
Learner-centered, inclusive and backward design frameworks 
Applied learning research and theory in team-based projects
Communicating design choices and concepts to diverse stakeholders

                                                  ›              Design for Learning
                            


 Design for Learning
Students in the Design for Learning minor, offered by the Human-Computer Interaction Institute (HCII), combine skills to imagine, design, iterate, and evaluate effective new media systems for learning—from creating games for learning to integrating adaptive ed-tech and augmented reality experiences into diverse learning settings. In team-based collaborations, students focus on the critical design of learning platforms, products, and systems that leverage emerging technologies, learning science research, inclusive design, and data analytics to create engaging educational experiences with measurable real-world impact.
Students in Design for Learning courses can bring media-making and prototyping competencies gained in other IDeATe areas (e.g. Game Design, Media Design, Physical Computing, Immersive Technologies in Arts & Humanities) to craft innovative learning experiences.
Through coursework in the minor, you will gain skills and competencies in: 

Learning design research and evaluation methods 
Concept modeling and prototyping techniques 
Learner-centered, inclusive and backward design frameworks 
Applied learning research and theory in team-based projects
Communicating design choices and concepts to diverse stakeholders
