These systems have become omnipresent without our necessarily understanding them. They are not just black boxes, but invisible: entities in our homes and everyday lives which work through hidden flows of data, unknown agendas, imaginary clouds, mysterious sets of rules which we perhaps dismiss as ‘algorithms’ or even ‘AI’ without really understanding what that means. What creative research opportunities are there at this intersection? This ongoing design research project aims to investigate these opportunities, in the process enabling students to gain familiarity with an under-explored dimension of our relationship with technology.Crowdsourcing, Constructing and Collaborating: Methods and Social Impacts of Mapping the World Today (2020)Co-edited by Nida RehmanThis book is a collection of essays by individuals and groups engaged in building and sustaining platforms for online collaboration and participation to critically reflect on the tactics, methods, challenges, and opportunities of crowdsourcing and crowd-mapping as tools for social, environmental, and political change. In an accessible and visually engaging style, it shows how participatory digital media have become crucial components of journalistic, scholarly, and activist practices, addressing a range of topical challenges, including economic corruption, sexual harassment, political violence, and environmental conflict in diverse geographic contexts.Other Computations: Digital Technologies for Architecture from the Global South (2020)Co-edited by Daniel Cardoso LlachA new special issue of the architecture journal Dearq co-edited by School of Architecture Associate Professor Daniel Cardoso Llach explores computational design practices in architecture outside of the “global North,” challenging Anglo and Euro-centric understandings of computation in architecture. The issue, entitled Other Computations, comprises eight peer-reviewed articles, one invited essay, reviews of projects by Southern practitioners, and an afterword by historian of architecture and technology Antoine Picon. Prof. Cardoso Llach co-edited the issue with media scholar and artist Andrés Burbano, an Associate Professor at the School of Design at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá. Read the editors' introductory essay. The entire issue is available open access. Nonconventional and Vernacular Construction Materials: Characterization, Properties, and Applications, (2nd ed.) (2019)Then adjunct faculty and School of Architecture alumna Lola Ben-Alon co-authored “Chapter 4: Codes and Standards Development for Nonconventional and Vernacular Materials” with co-authors Harries, K. A. & Sharma, B. Nonconventional and Vernacular Construction Materials: Characterisation, Properties and Applications provides a comprehensive repository of information on materials science and the modern structural engineering application of ancient, vernacular, and nonconventional building materials, with leading experts contributing chapters that focus on current applications and the engineering of these construction materials.Pittsburgh Municipal Building Benchmarking Report (2019)By Flore Marion, PhD-BPD candidate and the Sustainability and Resilience Division of the Department of City Planning (Pittsburgh)The Pittsburgh Municipal Building Benchmarking Report is part of Pittsburgh's goal to eliminate water and energy waste and is a testament to the ways in which the School of Architecture and City of Pittsburgh can work together to achieve shared goals. In May 2018, Pittsburgh City Council approved the Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan 3.0, under which the City seeks to achieve dramatic greenhouse gas reductions by 2050 in an effort to address climate change and create a stronger, healthier, and more resilient Pittsburgh. Under this plan, established by Mayor William Peduto, the City aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. It also seeks to reduce energy and water use by 50 percent by 2030.Women and GIS: Mapping Their Stories (2019) By Esri PressTeaching Professor Kristen Kurland is one of 23 women featured in this publication from Esri Press. Her chapter "The Heart of a Giving Teacher" includes her work in GIS and Urban Design at Carnegie Mellon University.Women look to other women as role models and for inspiration. Seeing confidence, leadership, and accomplishments in other women helps a young woman envision herself with those qualities. Women and GIS: Mapping Their Stories tells the tales of how 23 women applied themselves and overcame obstacles, using maps, analysis, and geographic information systems (GIS) to contribute to their professions and the world. Sharing the experiences of their childhoods, the misstarts and challenges they faced, and the lessons they learned, each story is a celebration of a woman’s unique path and of the perseverance and hard work it takes to achieve success. From oceanographers to activists, archaeologists to entrepreneurs, the women in Women and GIS: Mapping Their Stories can serve as mentors to motivate readers who are developing their own life stories and inspire their potential in a new way.Flexibility and Design: Learning from the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) Project (2018) By Joshua D. LeeThe first book by Assistant Professor Joshua D. Lee, PhD, AIA, published by Routedge, questions flexibility as a design approach by providing a longitudinal analysis of an innovative architectural experiment called the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) project. The SCSD pioneered the use of performance specifications to create an open, prefabricated, and integrated system of building components that provided four modes of flexibility. Educational facilities throughout California used the SCSD system and it spawned a variety of similar projects throughout North America. This book traces the development and subsequent use of the system over 50 years through archival research, personal observations, re-photography, re-surveying, plan evaluations, interviews, and an advertisement analysis. These new findings provide useful insights for architects, educators, historic preservationists, and others about the affordances of spatial flexibility, the difficulties associated with technological transfer, the impact of unstable market conditions, the importance of user input during the planning process, and the need for long-term social relations to sustain architectural experiments.Public Interest Design Education Guidebook: Curricula, Strategies, and SEED Academic Case Studies (2018)By Lisa M. Abendroth & Bryan BellThis guidebook presents the pedagogical framework and collective curriculum necessary to teach public interest designers. The book’s editors and contributors feature a range of learning competencies supported by distinct teaching strategies where educational and community-originated goals unite. Written in a guidebook format that includes projects from across design disciplines, this book describes the learning deemed most critical to pursuing an inclusive, informed design practice that meets the diverse needs of both students and community partners. The book features the work of the UDBS and PROJECT RE_.Designing the Computational Image, Imagining Computational Design (2017)Exhibition Catalog Curated by Professor Daniel Cardoso LlachDesigning the Computational Image, Imagining Computational Design at the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon is an exhibition showcasing rare photographs, film, high-quality reproductions, and interactive software reconstructions examining the formative period of numerical control and Computer-Aided Design technologies (1949-1976), along with a selection of experimental work by computational designers working today.Computational Design: Practices, Histories, Infrastructures symposium (2017)Symposium Brochure Organized by Professor Daniel Cardoso LlachThis two-day event at Carnegie Mellon University examines computation as a subject of both scholarly and creative inquiry in architecture and other design fields. It accompanies the exhibition Designing the Computational Image, Imagining Computational Design and seeks to situate contemporary design methods in architecture and other creative fields in relation to broader histories, disciplinary frames, and technical infrastructures.of More-Than-Human Spaces (2017)An Interdisciplinary Panel Discussion Organized by Professor Nida RehmanThis interdisciplinary panel discussion reflects on the historical roles (expected and unexpected) of non-human others in crafting urban and regional landscapes, and the politics, biopolitics, and aesthetics of more-than-human interactions. Participants will foreground their work on, with or alongside non-humans, in blurred 'nature-culture borderlands', to rethink the messy politics of expertise, the assemblage of agency, and explore the unforeseen spaces that design and planning entail. Carnegie Mellon Architecture, 5000 Forbes Avenue, College of Fine Arts 201, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 | 412.268.2354Statement of Assurance | Legal Info | Contact Us | Careers | Donate Copyright ©  Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture | All Rights Reserved

Spooky Technology: A reflection on the invisible and otherworldly qualities in everyday technologies (2021)By Daragh Byrne and Dan Lockton with contributions from CMU students We often hear that the technologies in our everyday lives would appear to be ‘magic’ and potentially terrifying to people in the past, but rarely are these ‘otherworldly’ dimensions of technologies explored in more detail. These systems have become omnipresent without our necessarily understanding them. They are not just black boxes, but invisible: entities in our homes and everyday lives which work through hidden flows of data, unknown agendas, imaginary clouds, mysterious sets of rules which we perhaps dismiss as ‘algorithms’ or even ‘AI’ without really understanding what that means. What creative research opportunities are there at this intersection? This ongoing design research project aims to investigate these opportunities, in the process enabling students to gain familiarity with an under-explored dimension of our relationship with technology.

Crowdsourcing, Constructing and Collaborating: Methods and Social Impacts of Mapping the World Today (2020)Co-edited by Nida RehmanThis book is a collection of essays by individuals and groups engaged in building and sustaining platforms for online collaboration and participation to critically reflect on the tactics, methods, challenges, and opportunities of crowdsourcing and crowd-mapping as tools for social, environmental, and political change. In an accessible and visually engaging style, it shows how participatory digital media have become crucial components of journalistic, scholarly, and activist practices, addressing a range of topical challenges, including economic corruption, sexual harassment, political violence, and environmental conflict in diverse geographic contexts.

 













Other Computations: Digital Technologies for Architecture from the Global South (2020)Co-edited by Daniel Cardoso LlachA new special issue of the architecture journal Dearq co-edited by School of Architecture Associate Professor Daniel Cardoso Llach explores computational design practices in architecture outside of the “global North,” challenging Anglo and Euro-centric understandings of computation in architecture. The issue, entitled Other Computations, comprises eight peer-reviewed articles, one invited essay, reviews of projects by Southern practitioners, and an afterword by historian of architecture and technology Antoine Picon. Prof. Cardoso Llach co-edited the issue with media scholar and artist Andrés Burbano, an Associate Professor at the School of Design at Universidad de los Andes, Bogotá.

Pittsburgh Municipal Building Benchmarking Report (2019)By Flore Marion, PhD-BPD candidate and the Sustainability and Resilience Division of the Department of City Planning (Pittsburgh)The Pittsburgh Municipal Building Benchmarking Report is part of Pittsburgh's goal to eliminate water and energy waste and is a testament to the ways in which the School of Architecture and City of Pittsburgh can work together to achieve shared goals. In May 2018, Pittsburgh City Council approved the Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan 3.0, under which the City seeks to achieve dramatic greenhouse gas reductions by 2050 in an effort to address climate change and create a stronger, healthier, and more resilient Pittsburgh. Under this plan, established by Mayor William Peduto, the City aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. It also seeks to reduce energy and water use by 50 percent by 2030.

Women and GIS: Mapping Their Stories (2019) By Esri PressTeaching Professor Kristen Kurland is one of 23 women featured in this publication from Esri Press. Her chapter "The Heart of a Giving Teacher" includes her work in GIS and Urban Design at Carnegie Mellon University.Women look to other women as role models and for inspiration. Seeing confidence, leadership, and accomplishments in other women helps a young woman envision herself with those qualities. Women and GIS: Mapping Their Stories tells the tales of how 23 women applied themselves and overcame obstacles, using maps, analysis, and geographic information systems (GIS) to contribute to their professions and the world. Sharing the experiences of their childhoods, the misstarts and challenges they faced, and the lessons they learned, each story is a celebration of a woman’s unique path and of the perseverance and hard work it takes to achieve success. From oceanographers to activists, archaeologists to entrepreneurs, the women in Women and GIS: Mapping Their Stories can serve as mentors to motivate readers who are developing their own life stories and inspire their potential in a new way.

Flexibility and Design: Learning from the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) Project (2018) By Joshua D. LeeThe first book by Assistant Professor Joshua D. Lee, PhD, AIA, published by Routedge, questions flexibility as a design approach by providing a longitudinal analysis of an innovative architectural experiment called the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) project. The SCSD pioneered the use of performance specifications to create an open, prefabricated, and integrated system of building components that provided four modes of flexibility. Educational facilities throughout California used the SCSD system and it spawned a variety of similar projects throughout North America. This book traces the development and subsequent use of the system over 50 years through archival research, personal observations, re-photography, re-surveying, plan evaluations, interviews, and an advertisement analysis. These new findings provide useful insights for architects, educators, historic preservationists, and others about the affordances of spatial flexibility, the difficulties associated with technological transfer, the impact of unstable market conditions, the importance of user input during the planning process, and the need for long-term social relations to sustain architectural experiments.

of More-Than-Human Spaces (2017)An Interdisciplinary Panel Discussion Organized by Professor Nida RehmanThis interdisciplinary panel discussion reflects on the historical roles (expected and unexpected) of non-human others in crafting urban and regional landscapes, and the politics, biopolitics, and aesthetics of more-than-human interactions. Participants will foreground their work on, with or alongside non-humans, in blurred 'nature-culture borderlands', to rethink the messy politics of expertise, the assemblage of agency, and explore the unforeseen spaces that design and planning entail.

Spooky Technology: A reflection on the invisible and otherworldly qualities in everyday technologies (2021)By Daragh Byrne and Dan Lockton with contributions from CMU students We often hear that the technologies in our everyday lives would appear to be ‘magic’ and potentially terrifying to people in the past, but rarely are these ‘otherworldly’ dimensions of technologies explored in more detail. These systems have become omnipresent without our necessarily understanding them. They are not just black boxes, but invisible: entities in our homes and everyday lives which work through hidden flows of data, unknown agendas, imaginary clouds, mysterious sets of rules which we perhaps dismiss as ‘algorithms’ or even ‘AI’ without really understanding what that means. What creative research opportunities are there at this intersection? This ongoing design research project aims to investigate these opportunities, in the process enabling students to gain familiarity with an under-explored dimension of our relationship with technology.

Pittsburgh Municipal Building Benchmarking Report (2019)By Flore Marion, PhD-BPD candidate and the Sustainability and Resilience Division of the Department of City Planning (Pittsburgh)The Pittsburgh Municipal Building Benchmarking Report is part of Pittsburgh's goal to eliminate water and energy waste and is a testament to the ways in which the School of Architecture and City of Pittsburgh can work together to achieve shared goals. In May 2018, Pittsburgh City Council approved the Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan 3.0, under which the City seeks to achieve dramatic greenhouse gas reductions by 2050 in an effort to address climate change and create a stronger, healthier, and more resilient Pittsburgh. Under this plan, established by Mayor William Peduto, the City aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. It also seeks to reduce energy and water use by 50 percent by 2030.

Flexibility and Design: Learning from the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) Project (2018) By Joshua D. LeeThe first book by Assistant Professor Joshua D. Lee, PhD, AIA, published by Routedge, questions flexibility as a design approach by providing a longitudinal analysis of an innovative architectural experiment called the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) project. The SCSD pioneered the use of performance specifications to create an open, prefabricated, and integrated system of building components that provided four modes of flexibility. Educational facilities throughout California used the SCSD system and it spawned a variety of similar projects throughout North America. This book traces the development and subsequent use of the system over 50 years through archival research, personal observations, re-photography, re-surveying, plan evaluations, interviews, and an advertisement analysis. These new findings provide useful insights for architects, educators, historic preservationists, and others about the affordances of spatial flexibility, the difficulties associated with technological transfer, the impact of unstable market conditions, the importance of user input during the planning process, and the need for long-term social relations to sustain architectural experiments.

of More-Than-Human Spaces (2017)An Interdisciplinary Panel Discussion Organized by Professor Nida RehmanThis interdisciplinary panel discussion reflects on the historical roles (expected and unexpected) of non-human others in crafting urban and regional landscapes, and the politics, biopolitics, and aesthetics of more-than-human interactions. Participants will foreground their work on, with or alongside non-humans, in blurred 'nature-culture borderlands', to rethink the messy politics of expertise, the assemblage of agency, and explore the unforeseen spaces that design and planning entail.

Spooky Technology: A reflection on the invisible and otherworldly qualities in everyday technologies (2021)By Daragh Byrne and Dan Lockton with contributions from CMU students We often hear that the technologies in our everyday lives would appear to be ‘magic’ and potentially terrifying to people in the past, but rarely are these ‘otherworldly’ dimensions of technologies explored in more detail. These systems have become omnipresent without our necessarily understanding them. They are not just black boxes, but invisible: entities in our homes and everyday lives which work through hidden flows of data, unknown agendas, imaginary clouds, mysterious sets of rules which we perhaps dismiss as ‘algorithms’ or even ‘AI’ without really understanding what that means. What creative research opportunities are there at this intersection? This ongoing design research project aims to investigate these opportunities, in the process enabling students to gain familiarity with an under-explored dimension of our relationship with technology.

Pittsburgh Municipal Building Benchmarking Report (2019)By Flore Marion, PhD-BPD candidate and the Sustainability and Resilience Division of the Department of City Planning (Pittsburgh)The Pittsburgh Municipal Building Benchmarking Report is part of Pittsburgh's goal to eliminate water and energy waste and is a testament to the ways in which the School of Architecture and City of Pittsburgh can work together to achieve shared goals. In May 2018, Pittsburgh City Council approved the Pittsburgh Climate Action Plan 3.0, under which the City seeks to achieve dramatic greenhouse gas reductions by 2050 in an effort to address climate change and create a stronger, healthier, and more resilient Pittsburgh. Under this plan, established by Mayor William Peduto, the City aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. It also seeks to reduce energy and water use by 50 percent by 2030.

Flexibility and Design: Learning from the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) Project (2018) By Joshua D. LeeThe first book by Assistant Professor Joshua D. Lee, PhD, AIA, published by Routedge, questions flexibility as a design approach by providing a longitudinal analysis of an innovative architectural experiment called the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) project. The SCSD pioneered the use of performance specifications to create an open, prefabricated, and integrated system of building components that provided four modes of flexibility. Educational facilities throughout California used the SCSD system and it spawned a variety of similar projects throughout North America. This book traces the development and subsequent use of the system over 50 years through archival research, personal observations, re-photography, re-surveying, plan evaluations, interviews, and an advertisement analysis. These new findings provide useful insights for architects, educators, historic preservationists, and others about the affordances of spatial flexibility, the difficulties associated with technological transfer, the impact of unstable market conditions, the importance of user input during the planning process, and the need for long-term social relations to sustain architectural experiments.

These new findings provide useful insights for architects, educators, historic preservationists, and others about the affordances of spatial flexibility, the difficulties associated with technological transfer, the impact of unstable market conditions, the importance of user input during the planning process, and the need for long-term social relations to sustain architectural experiments.


Flexibility and Design: Learning from the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) Project (2018) By Joshua D. LeeThe first book by Assistant Professor Joshua D. Lee, PhD, AIA, published by Routedge, questions flexibility as a design approach by providing a longitudinal analysis of an innovative architectural experiment called the School Construction Systems Development (SCSD) project. The SCSD pioneered the use of performance specifications to create an open, prefabricated, and integrated system of building components that provided four modes of flexibility. Educational facilities throughout California used the SCSD system and it spawned a variety of similar projects throughout North America. This book traces the development and subsequent use of the system over 50 years through archival research, personal observations, re-photography, re-surveying, plan evaluations, interviews, and an advertisement analysis.

of More-Than-Human Spaces (2017)An Interdisciplinary Panel Discussion Organized by Professor Nida RehmanThis interdisciplinary panel discussion reflects on the historical roles (expected and unexpected) of non-human others in crafting urban and regional landscapes, and the politics, biopolitics, and aesthetics of more-than-human interactions. Participants will foreground their work on, with or alongside non-humans, in blurred 'nature-culture borderlands', to rethink the messy politics of expertise, the assemblage of agency, and explore the unforeseen spaces that design and planning entail.
