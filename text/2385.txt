In May, our men’s golf team became Carnegie Mellon’s first-ever NCAA Division III Champions. With an exceptional 9-under-par final round, they finished first among 43 teams during their fourth straight championship appearance. In addition, our women’s golf team placed fourth at their championship. These are just two of many successes within our Tartan Athletics program this year. Congratulations to Director of Athletics Josh Centor, Coach Dan Rodgers and both teams!Before turning to the stories included in this edition, I want to share more recent news from our bustling campuses. Under a glorious sunny sky at this year’s Commencement, we awarded 6,933 degrees to the Class of 2023. This incredible group of students has persevered through so much the past four years, and I am confident they are prepared to change the world for the better. As part of Commencement, we also awarded honorary degrees to five exceptional individuals, including our keynote speaker and Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger; alumni Fred Eversley, Lt. Gen. Gina Grosso and Judith Light; and Emeritus Trustee David Shapira.READ PRESIDENT JAHANIAN'S LETTER TO THE CMU AMBASSADORS AS WELL AS FEATURED ARTICLES

 July 2023 

It’s not every day that I am able to begin a CMU Ambassador letter with a history-making sports update! In May, our men’s golf team became Carnegie Mellon’s first-ever NCAA Division III Champions. With an exceptional 9-under-par final round, they finished first among 43 teams during their fourth straight championship appearance. In addition, our women’s golf team placed fourth at their championship. These are just two of many successes within our Tartan Athletics program this year. Congratulations to Director of Athletics Josh Centor, Coach Dan Rodgers and both teams!Before turning to the stories included in this edition, I want to share more recent news from our bustling campuses. Under a glorious sunny sky at this year’s Commencement, we awarded 6,933 degrees to the Class of 2023. This incredible group of students has persevered through so much the past four years, and I am confident they are prepared to change the world for the better. As part of Commencement, we also awarded honorary degrees to five exceptional individuals, including our keynote speaker and Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger; alumni Fred Eversley, Lt. Gen. Gina Grosso and Judith Light; and Emeritus Trustee David Shapira.

 July 2023 

It’s not every day that I am able to begin a CMU Ambassador letter with a history-making sports update! In May, our men’s golf team became Carnegie Mellon’s first-ever NCAA Division III Champions. With an exceptional 9-under-par final round, they finished first among 43 teams during their fourth straight championship appearance. In addition, our women’s golf team placed fourth at their championship. These are just two of many successes within our Tartan Athletics program this year. Congratulations to Director of Athletics Josh Centor, Coach Dan Rodgers and both teams!Before turning to the stories included in this edition, I want to share more recent news from our bustling campuses. Under a glorious sunny sky at this year’s Commencement, we awarded 6,933 degrees to the Class of 2023. This incredible group of students has persevered through so much the past four years, and I am confident they are prepared to change the world for the better. As part of Commencement, we also awarded honorary degrees to five exceptional individuals, including our keynote speaker and Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger; alumni Fred Eversley, Lt. Gen. Gina Grosso and Judith Light; and Emeritus Trustee David Shapira.

It’s not every day that I am able to begin a CMU Ambassador letter with a history-making sports update! In May, our men’s golf team became Carnegie Mellon’s first-ever NCAA Division III Champions. With an exceptional 9-under-par final round, they finished first among 43 teams during their fourth straight championship appearance. In addition, our women’s golf team placed fourth at their championship. These are just two of many successes within our Tartan Athletics program this year. Congratulations to Director of Athletics Josh Centor, Coach Dan Rodgers and both teams!Before turning to the stories included in this edition, I want to share more recent news from our bustling campuses. Under a glorious sunny sky at this year’s Commencement, we awarded 6,933 degrees to the Class of 2023. This incredible group of students has persevered through so much the past four years, and I am confident they are prepared to change the world for the better. As part of Commencement, we also awarded honorary degrees to five exceptional individuals, including our keynote speaker and Intel CEO, Pat Gelsinger; alumni Fred Eversley, Lt. Gen. Gina Grosso and Judith Light; and Emeritus Trustee David Shapira.
