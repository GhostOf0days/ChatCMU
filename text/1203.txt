The Research and Scholarship Digest, published the first Monday of each month, consists of short summaries of recently peer-reviewed studies on teaching and learning topics. This digest offers a view into what we are reading and thinking about at the Eberly Center that:• adds to our understanding of how students learn• is potentially generalizable across teaching contexts in higher education• provokes reflection on implications for our teaching and educational development practices.We hope the readers of this digest will find it a useful resource for staying in-tune with the rapidly expanding education research literature.The term “growth mindset” is often used to describe individuals’ implicit attitudes toward general intelligence on a continuum of being able to cultivate and improve it versus it being innately “fixed'' at whatever level they were born with. As plenty of research has shown, however, these implicit attitudes are often domain-specific (i.e., one can hold different implicit attitudes toward different areas of their lives). The authors of this paper investigated this idea in the domain of student interests - the beliefs that a student can cultivate or develop a particular passion or interest, rather than merely “finding” it, which suggests that it is a fixed or predetermined entity. Indeed, students are often told to “find their passion”, which the authors speculate may discourage students from developing interests they have not already “found”. In two quasi-experiments, the authors found that after completing a brief (30 minutes) intervention in the form of an online module about the “growth theory” of interest development prior to the start of school, first-year students who did not initially report having strong interest in their required math and science courses reported having stronger interests at the end of the year, as well as better grades, when compared to controls. These findings suggest that more deliberately framing how students’ interests are developed (not simply found, fully intact) may help broaden student interest development as well as achievement. O'Keefe, P. A., Horberg, E. J., Dweck, C. S., & Walton, G. M. (2023). Journal of Educational Psychology.[link to article The authors present the results of an experiment showing that artificial intelligence detection tools perform differently depending on whether the writing being analyzed was originally written in English or one of three other languages. The tools correctly differentiated GPT-generated vs. human-authored essays written in English, and gave intermediate scores for essays written in English by a human and then run through a paraphrasing tool. But GPT-generated essays written in Malay, Mandarin, and Japanese were not detected. Perhaps of more concern in our local context, running human-authored essays through AI translation and paraphrasing tools (Google Translate and Quillbot AI) led to them being flagged as AI-generated. Any aid from AI tools was flagged--a potential equity concern because these tools are anecdotally reported to be used more by non-native English writers. Current AI detection tools are unable to differentiate between different kinds of AI contribution (full writing vs. translation and paraphrasing). The authors call for a nuanced discussion and clear standards around what forms of AI assistance are acceptable in specific contexts. BioScience, biad034.[link to article][Read the Archive]As you read, know that we are not necessarily endorsing a particular study or its conclusions, rather that we found it worth thinking about and discussing with colleagues as part of our ongoing professional development efforts.

What’s the Eberly Center reading and thinking about this month?
The Research and Scholarship Digest, published the first Monday of each month, consists of short summaries of recently peer-reviewed studies on teaching and learning topics. This digest offers a view into what we are reading and thinking about at the Eberly Center that:
• adds to our understanding of how students learn• is potentially generalizable across teaching contexts in higher education• provokes reflection on implications for our teaching and educational development practices.
We hope the readers of this digest will find it a useful resource for staying in-tune with the rapidly expanding education research literature.

A growth-theory-of-interest intervention increases interest in math and science coursework among liberal arts undergraduates

The term “growth mindset” is often used to describe individuals’ implicit attitudes toward general intelligence on a continuum of being able to cultivate and improve it versus it being innately “fixed'' at whatever level they were born with. As plenty of research has shown, however, these implicit attitudes are often domain-specific (i.e., one can hold different implicit attitudes toward different areas of their lives). The authors of this paper investigated this idea in the domain of student interests - the beliefs that a student can cultivate or develop a particular passion or interest, rather than merely “finding” it, which suggests that it is a fixed or predetermined entity. Indeed, students are often told to “find their passion”, which the authors speculate may discourage students from developing interests they have not already “found”. In two quasi-experiments, the authors found that after completing a brief (30 minutes) intervention in the form of an online module about the “growth theory” of interest development prior to the start of school, first-year students who did not initially report having strong interest in their required math and science courses reported having stronger interests at the end of the year, as well as better grades, when compared to controls. These findings suggest that more deliberately framing how students’ interests are developed (not simply found, fully intact) may help broaden student interest development as well as achievement.

Non-English academics face inequality via AI-generated essays and countermeasure tools
The authors present the results of an experiment showing that artificial intelligence detection tools perform differently depending on whether the writing being analyzed was originally written in English or one of three other languages. The tools correctly differentiated GPT-generated vs. human-authored essays written in English, and gave intermediate scores for essays written in English by a human and then run through a paraphrasing tool. But GPT-generated essays written in Malay, Mandarin, and Japanese were not detected. Perhaps of more concern in our local context, running human-authored essays through AI translation and paraphrasing tools (Google Translate and Quillbot AI) led to them being flagged as AI-generated. Any aid from AI tools was flagged--a potential equity concern because these tools are anecdotally reported to be used more by non-native English writers. Current AI detection tools are unable to differentiate between different kinds of AI contribution (full writing vs. translation and paraphrasing). The authors call for a nuanced discussion and clear standards around what forms of AI assistance are acceptable in specific contexts.

What’s the Eberly Center reading and thinking about this month?
The Research and Scholarship Digest, published the first Monday of each month, consists of short summaries of recently peer-reviewed studies on teaching and learning topics. This digest offers a view into what we are reading and thinking about at the Eberly Center that:
• adds to our understanding of how students learn• is potentially generalizable across teaching contexts in higher education• provokes reflection on implications for our teaching and educational development practices.
We hope the readers of this digest will find it a useful resource for staying in-tune with the rapidly expanding education research literature.

A growth-theory-of-interest intervention increases interest in math and science coursework among liberal arts undergraduates

The term “growth mindset” is often used to describe individuals’ implicit attitudes toward general intelligence on a continuum of being able to cultivate and improve it versus it being innately “fixed'' at whatever level they were born with. As plenty of research has shown, however, these implicit attitudes are often domain-specific (i.e., one can hold different implicit attitudes toward different areas of their lives). The authors of this paper investigated this idea in the domain of student interests - the beliefs that a student can cultivate or develop a particular passion or interest, rather than merely “finding” it, which suggests that it is a fixed or predetermined entity. Indeed, students are often told to “find their passion”, which the authors speculate may discourage students from developing interests they have not already “found”. In two quasi-experiments, the authors found that after completing a brief (30 minutes) intervention in the form of an online module about the “growth theory” of interest development prior to the start of school, first-year students who did not initially report having strong interest in their required math and science courses reported having stronger interests at the end of the year, as well as better grades, when compared to controls. These findings suggest that more deliberately framing how students’ interests are developed (not simply found, fully intact) may help broaden student interest development as well as achievement.

Non-English academics face inequality via AI-generated essays and countermeasure tools
The authors present the results of an experiment showing that artificial intelligence detection tools perform differently depending on whether the writing being analyzed was originally written in English or one of three other languages. The tools correctly differentiated GPT-generated vs. human-authored essays written in English, and gave intermediate scores for essays written in English by a human and then run through a paraphrasing tool. But GPT-generated essays written in Malay, Mandarin, and Japanese were not detected. Perhaps of more concern in our local context, running human-authored essays through AI translation and paraphrasing tools (Google Translate and Quillbot AI) led to them being flagged as AI-generated. Any aid from AI tools was flagged--a potential equity concern because these tools are anecdotally reported to be used more by non-native English writers. Current AI detection tools are unable to differentiate between different kinds of AI contribution (full writing vs. translation and paraphrasing). The authors call for a nuanced discussion and clear standards around what forms of AI assistance are acceptable in specific contexts.

What’s the Eberly Center reading and thinking about this month?
The Research and Scholarship Digest, published the first Monday of each month, consists of short summaries of recently peer-reviewed studies on teaching and learning topics. This digest offers a view into what we are reading and thinking about at the Eberly Center that:
• adds to our understanding of how students learn• is potentially generalizable across teaching contexts in higher education• provokes reflection on implications for our teaching and educational development practices.
We hope the readers of this digest will find it a useful resource for staying in-tune with the rapidly expanding education research literature.

A growth-theory-of-interest intervention increases interest in math and science coursework among liberal arts undergraduates

The term “growth mindset” is often used to describe individuals’ implicit attitudes toward general intelligence on a continuum of being able to cultivate and improve it versus it being innately “fixed'' at whatever level they were born with. As plenty of research has shown, however, these implicit attitudes are often domain-specific (i.e., one can hold different implicit attitudes toward different areas of their lives). The authors of this paper investigated this idea in the domain of student interests - the beliefs that a student can cultivate or develop a particular passion or interest, rather than merely “finding” it, which suggests that it is a fixed or predetermined entity. Indeed, students are often told to “find their passion”, which the authors speculate may discourage students from developing interests they have not already “found”. In two quasi-experiments, the authors found that after completing a brief (30 minutes) intervention in the form of an online module about the “growth theory” of interest development prior to the start of school, first-year students who did not initially report having strong interest in their required math and science courses reported having stronger interests at the end of the year, as well as better grades, when compared to controls. These findings suggest that more deliberately framing how students’ interests are developed (not simply found, fully intact) may help broaden student interest development as well as achievement.

Non-English academics face inequality via AI-generated essays and countermeasure tools
The authors present the results of an experiment showing that artificial intelligence detection tools perform differently depending on whether the writing being analyzed was originally written in English or one of three other languages. The tools correctly differentiated GPT-generated vs. human-authored essays written in English, and gave intermediate scores for essays written in English by a human and then run through a paraphrasing tool. But GPT-generated essays written in Malay, Mandarin, and Japanese were not detected. Perhaps of more concern in our local context, running human-authored essays through AI translation and paraphrasing tools (Google Translate and Quillbot AI) led to them being flagged as AI-generated. Any aid from AI tools was flagged--a potential equity concern because these tools are anecdotally reported to be used more by non-native English writers. Current AI detection tools are unable to differentiate between different kinds of AI contribution (full writing vs. translation and paraphrasing). The authors call for a nuanced discussion and clear standards around what forms of AI assistance are acceptable in specific contexts.
