The MSCV program is a professional degree that prepares students for industry and a career related to computer vision. It is a full-time 16-month program, spanning three semesters and one summer. Students are required to complete 111 units to be eligible for graduation. The curriculum consists of five core courses (total of 60 units), two MSCV project courses (total of 24 units), two electives (total of 24 units), and a required summer internship (3 units). Since computer vision is a rapidly changing field, this course of study is subject to change in order to reflect state of the art updates. Summer Term: 3 units of CV-related internshipThe core courses are designed to cover the necessary foundations in math, machine learning, and computer vision. Our goal is to address the two main areas of current computer vision systems (1) recognition (including images and videos, and web-based applications), and (2) geometry (including multi-view reconstruction, Web-scale reconstruction, SLAM). The electives offer a complement of specialized aspects of computer vision, together with further material on machine learning.Students are required to complete 3 units of Internship during the summer in order to meet the 111-unit total for graduation. Summer internships must be relevant to computer vision. If unsure, students can gain approval from the MSCV Program Director. Students must register for 3 units of internship credit and will be required to submit a final report documenting the work that they completed during the internship. The MSCV faculty will review the final report and assign the student a pass/fail grade for his/her work. As an alternative to an internship, students may stay on campus to intern with a Professor.This program will include two project courses to facilitate the development of computer vision software. MSCV Project I & II will be offered in the second and third semesters. The project course will allow students to form small teams that will focus on a hands-on computer vision topic proposed by the course instructor, core faculty, or industry colleagues. Students may propose projects independently but they will have to be reviewed and approved by the core program faculty. All projects will be supervised and coordinated by the MSCV faculty. The project is intended to allow students to acquire hands-on experience and apply concepts and methods taught in class. Students will learn the challenges of real-world software development.

The project course will allow students to form small teams that will focus on a hands-on computer vision topic proposed by the course instructor, core faculty, or industry colleagues. Students may propose projects independently but they will have to be reviewed and approved by the core program faculty. All projects will be supervised and coordinated by the MSCV faculty. The project is intended to allow students to acquire hands-on experience and apply concepts and methods taught in class. Students will learn the challenges of real-world software development. The outcome of this course will be a final project report, coupled with a demonstration and presentation.

MSCV Program Curriculum
The MSCV program is a professional degree that prepares students for industry and a career related to computer vision. It is a full-time 16-month program, spanning three semesters and one summer. Students are required to complete 111 units to be eligible for graduation. The curriculum consists of five core courses (total of 60 units), two MSCV project courses (total of 24 units), two electives (total of 24 units), and a required summer internship (3 units). Since computer vision is a rapidly changing field, this course of study is subject to change in order to reflect state of the art updates.

The core courses are designed to cover the necessary foundations in math, machine learning, and computer vision. Our goal is to address the two main areas of current computer vision systems (1) recognition (including images and videos, and web-based applications), and (2) geometry (including multi-view reconstruction, Web-scale reconstruction, SLAM). The electives offer a complement of specialized aspects of computer vision, together with further material on machine learning.
Students are required to complete 3 units of Internship during the summer in order to meet the 111-unit total for graduation. Summer internships must be relevant to computer vision. If unsure, students can gain approval from the MSCV Program Director. Students must register for 3 units of internship credit and will be required to submit a final report documenting the work that they completed during the internship. The MSCV faculty will review the final report and assign the student a pass/fail grade for his/her work. As an alternative to an internship, students may stay on campus to intern with a Professor.
