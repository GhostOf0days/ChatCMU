Please plan ahead and request your recommendation letter(s) through our online application process in time for us to receive them by the application deadline.

Standardized Test Scores (optional)
Standardized tests scores are NOT required for application. However, you are welcome to submit your test scores if you feel they will strengthen your application submission. Please note that these test scores will be only one part of our holistic review process.
If you choose to submit your standardized tests scores, please upload the test score report of your most recent PSAT, SAT, PreACT or ACT.
Essay Requirements
Essay requirements vary by program. Please reference the academic program pages for more information. Essay prompts will be listed.

Supplemental Materials (if applicable)
Depending on your program(s) of interest, supplemental materials (such as a video audition or images of your unique work) may be required to complete your application. Please reference the academic program pages for more information.

We highly encourage students to participate in our residential program as it provides a more comprehensive college-life experience. However, you can still greatly benefit from our commuter programs.
To be eligible as a commuter student, the student and parent/guardian must have a permanent residence within approximately 30 miles of campus or within Allegheny County. Exceptions to this requirement will NOT be considered.

Please find complete information on application and enrollment processes for international students here.
English Proficiency Requirements
If your native language is not English, we require a TOEFL score of 102 or better on the iBT (internet-based test) or iBT Home Edition, a TOEFL Essentials overall band score of at least 11, an IELTS score of 7.5 or above, or a Duolingo English Test (DET) overall score of 125 or above. Please arrange to have these scores uploaded with your application materials. Your official TOEFL, IELTS, or DET scores reports are required. Carnegie Mellon’s Pre-College Programs' TOEFL code is C534.
If you are an international student who has attended a high school within the United States for a minimum of one year and plan to return to that high school after participation in our Pre-College Programs, you are exempt from the TOEFL/IELTS/DET requirement. Your unofficial transcripts must clearly show your attendance at a high school in the United States for the one-year minimum.

Application Fee

This application fee is waived for applicants requesting scholarship consideration or if they are applying to AI Scholars, Computer Science Scholars, and/or Summer Academy for Math and Science.

Students who live in federally subsidized public housing, a foster home, or are homeless.
Students who are a ward of the state or an orphan.
Students who can provide a supporting statement from a school official, college access counselor, financial aid officer, or community leader.

Students participating in Carnegie Mellon University’s Pre-College programs will be expected to abide by the University’s COVID-19 mitigation protocol in place at the time of programming. This is to safeguard the students, staff, faculty, and community.
Vaccine and testing documentation is not required for application submission, however, participating students will need to complete immunization records and forms during the enrollment process. As part of this process, the only acceptable documentation is the Carnegie Mellon Pre-College immunization/waiver forms (not the undergraduate forms). Related to COVID-19: Base-level vaccination is required (i.e. 2 shots Moderna/Pfizer or 1 shot J&J). Booster shots are only required if a sufficient amount of time has passed since the student’s underlying vaccination (eligibility to receive a booster shot is according to CDC guidelines). All documentation will be reviewed and verified.
CMU accepts all World Health Organization (WHO)-authorized vaccines, in addition to the FDA-authorized vaccines in the U.S.
