Students can apply for transfer during the semester in which they are completing the last of the six required courses:Students interested in transferring to robotics or pursuing a dual degree should first make an appointment for an initial consultation with the BSR Director. Students should then apply for transfer using SCS’s online transfer form by the mid-semester break in the semester when the last of the six required courses will be completed. Students should use the same form when applying for a dual degree. In the case of courses in progress, mid-semester grades will be used in the QPA calculation. The transfer and dual degree application includes a two-to-four-page, double-spaced essay that indicates your interests and any previous experience in robotics beyond coursework. The decision to allow transfer will be made by a committee with the advice of the associate dean for undergraduate programs based on the student’s academic performance in the specified courses (and in their courses overall if necessary); the essay; and space availability in the student’s class level.

Assuming applicants have achieved passing grades in the required courses, the decision to allow a transfer will be based on the applicant’s interest in robotics as expressed in their essay. Prior to submitting a transfer request, students should first consult with their current advisor and the BSR Director.
Information for Non-SCS Students
Students interested in transferring into the BSR program from a CMU college other than SCS must maintain at least a 3.0 QPA and complete the six courses below (some of which have options) with at least a 3.6 cumulative QPA in those courses. Students can apply for transfer during the semester in which they are completing the last of the six required courses:

Probability: one of 36-225, 21-325, 36-218 or 15-259.
Concepts of Math 21-127
Principles of Imperative Computation 15-122
Introduction to Computer Systems 15-213
Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science 15-251
Sophomore-level RI course one of 16-299, 16-311, 16-211, or Robot Building

Students interested in transferring to robotics or pursuing a dual degree should first make an appointment for an initial consultation with the BSR Director. Students should then apply for transfer using SCS’s online transfer form by the mid-semester break in the semester when the last of the six required courses will be completed. Students should use the same form when applying for a dual degree. In the case of courses in progress, mid-semester grades will be used in the QPA calculation. The transfer and dual degree application includes a two-to-four-page, double-spaced essay that indicates your interests and any previous experience in robotics beyond coursework. The decision to allow transfer will be made by a committee with the advice of the associate dean for undergraduate programs based on the student’s academic performance in the specified courses (and in their courses overall if necessary); the essay; and space availability in the student’s class level. Students should consult the SCS undergraduate office for up-to-date information concerning minimum requirements, instructions and deadlines.
Transfer into the Robotics program is not guaranteed, and students should continue to make progress in their current major and discuss their plans with their academic advisor carefully in the event that a transfer is not possible.




Information for SCS Students
Students who have already declared artificial intelligence, computer science, computational biology or human-computer interaction majors in the School of Computer Science may transfer to the BSR program. Transfer can be initiated at any time after the conditions below are met. This does not apply to first-year undeclared students, who will have the opportunity to be considered for the BSR major during the SCS major declaration process in March of their first year.
For students applying to transfer during AY 23-24, the following conditions must be met:

Have successfully completed at least four of the following courses: 15-122, 15-151, 15-213, 21-122, 21-241. A mid-semester grade is acceptable for one of them.
Complete the Internal Transfer Form, including an essay of 1-2 pages describing their interest in, and experience with robotics.
Student applying during Fall 2023 are strongly encouraged to apply by September 1st so that they have the opportunity to adjust their Fall semester schedule accordingly.
