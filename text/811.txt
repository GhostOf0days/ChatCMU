 Consumer Information
The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HEOA), requires institutions of higher education that participate in federal financial aid programs (e.g., federal loan programs, Pell grants, Federal Work-Study) to make available to students, parents, and others, specific information about their colleges and universities. This reporting ranges from general information about an institution, to its educational programs and services, to its policies, and to its student outcomes.

Distance Education, State Authorization and Reciprocity Agreement (SARA)
The State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) is an agreement among member states, districts, and territories in the United States, which establishes national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs. It is intended to standardize the process of offering online courses and programs by postsecondary institutions located in states other than the state in which the enrolled student(s) are residing. SARA is overseen by a national council (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts.
Carnegie Mellon University has been approved by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to participate in NC-SARA and was accepted as a SARA institution on May 2, 2017; additionally, Carnegie Mellon secured approval through NC-SARA on May 18, 2017. Carnegie Mellon University is listed as an approved, participating institution on the NC-SARA website (http://www.nc-sara.org/). At this time, 49 of the 50 United States are SARA members. California is not a member of SARA; however, Carnegie Mellon is able to offer online education to California residents.
Except where prohibited by applicable law, students who reside outside of the United States generally are not restricted from enrolling in our online programs. Some online programs do require in-person attendance at one of Carnegie Mellon’s teaching locations (e.g., Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania campus) for short portions of the program. Students interested in enrolling in a specific online program are encouraged to contact the person designated by the online program for questions about the program's requirements or enrollment.

Through the university’s participation in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA), you may access contact information for your state agency and instructions for filing complaints in your state using the SARA State Authorization Guide at https://nc-sara.org/guide/state-authorization-guide.

School of Architecture
The Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) and the Master of Architecture (M.Arch) degree programs are National Architecture Accrediting Board (NAAB)-accredited degree programs and meet the educational requirements for architectural licensure in all US States and the District of Columbia. Since each state has additional requirements for architectural licensure and those requirements vary among the states, students are advised to review the requirements for architectural licensure of the state in which they intend to obtain their license.

Students should also be aware that each state also has additional educator licensure requirements and those requirements vary among the states.  Students are advised to review the requirements for educator licensure of the state in which they intend to obtain their license prior to starting the academic program. Individual state educator licensing board websites are good resources for researching additional educator licensure requirements by state.
Pennsylvania also participates as a reciprocating state, which allows for educators holding an educator’s license in one state to earn a license in another state, subject to meeting specific state specific requirements of the other state. Information about educator licensure in Pennsylvania may be found on the PA Department of Education Website.
CIT/School of Engineering, Undergraduate Degree Programs
Carnegie Mellon’s engineering programs (Mechanical Engineering, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering) are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET. In order to obtain professional engineer licensure in any state, students must graduate from an ABET-accredited program and meet testing and/or work experience requirements of the state in which they intend to obtain their license. Students are advised to review the requirements for professional engineer licensure of the state in which they intend to obtain their license. Information about professional engineer licensure in Pennsylvania may be found on the PA Department of State website.
