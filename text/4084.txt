“[W]e do not want another liberal arts college in the traditional pattern. We want to develop a college which is well suited [...] to the needs of society in the years ahead. On this campus we have a perhaps unique combination of strengths in the sciences, in technology, and in the fine arts. [...] Rather than set up the usual kind of liberal arts college, we have an opportunity to be innovative, to institutionalize new educational ideas suited to the needs of the students and the times.”- Erwin Steinberg, Committee on Educational Affairs report to Carnegie Mellon University’s Executive Committee, September 18, 1967

 Different from the Very Beginning: Dietrich College Timeline


 “[W]e do not want another liberal arts college in the traditional pattern. We want to develop a college which is well suited [...] to the needs of society in the years ahead. On this campus we have a perhaps unique combination of strengths in the sciences, in technology, and in the fine arts. [...] Rather than set up the usual kind of liberal arts college, we have an opportunity to be innovative, to institutionalize new educational ideas suited to the needs of the students and the times.”
- Erwin Steinberg, Committee on Educational Affairs report to Carnegie Mellon University’s Executive Committee, September 18, 1967

 Different from the Very Beginning: Dietrich College Timeline


 “[W]e do not want another liberal arts college in the traditional pattern. We want to develop a college which is well suited [...] to the needs of society in the years ahead. On this campus we have a perhaps unique combination of strengths in the sciences, in technology, and in the fine arts. [...] Rather than set up the usual kind of liberal arts college, we have an opportunity to be innovative, to institutionalize new educational ideas suited to the needs of the students and the times.”
- Erwin Steinberg, Committee on Educational Affairs report to Carnegie Mellon University’s Executive Committee, September 18, 1967

 Different from the Very Beginning: Dietrich College Timeline

 “[W]e do not want another liberal arts college in the traditional pattern. We want to develop a college which is well suited [...] to the needs of society in the years ahead. On this campus we have a perhaps unique combination of strengths in the sciences, in technology, and in the fine arts. [...] Rather than set up the usual kind of liberal arts college, we have an opportunity to be innovative, to institutionalize new educational ideas suited to the needs of the students and the times.”
- Erwin Steinberg, Committee on Educational Affairs report to Carnegie Mellon University’s Executive Committee, September 18, 1967
