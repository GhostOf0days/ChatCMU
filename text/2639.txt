Each summer, dozens of talented undergraduates from around the world come to Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute for its Summer Scholars program (RISS), an intensive 11-week program introducing them to state-of-the-art robotics research. The remarkable post-program trajectories reflect the strong institute-wide partnerships, mentoring, and participation of over 50 members of the RI community annually and engagement of global sponsors.On Thursday, February 22, the RISS community welcomed a delegation of Indian leaders from industry and government, led by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) secretary general Mr. Dilip Chenoy and deputy secretary general Mr. Nirankar Saxena with leaders from government and
