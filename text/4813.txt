Carol Woody, PhD
Software Engineering Institute
 
Carol Woody has been a senior member of the SEI technical staff since 2001. Currently she is the technical manager for the Cyber Security Engineering (CSE) team, whose research focuses on meeting the challenges of cybersecurity in acquisition and in systems and software engineering.
Woody is an experienced technical researcher whose work has focused on government agencies, higher education, and medical organizations. As a consultant for ImageWork Technologies Corp., Woody managed the user testing for CITYTIME, a timekeeping application being developed for New York City. She also consulted with the Queens County District Attorney's Office of New York City to design and implement an electronic document management system. New York City's Administration for Child Services chose her to integrate financial information among state, city, and agency financial systems and also to construct a financial data warehouse and implement web-enabled processes for managing social-service payments. At Yale University, Woody served as architect and implementing project manager for an integrated ID-card solution, developed technical specifications, and assisted users in vendor review and selection for a procurement package, designed and implemented expert-system technology for distributed data collection, and managed a team of technicians supporting the financial operations of the university.
Woody holds a PhD in information science from Nova Southeastern University, an MBA from Wake Forest University, and a BS in mathematics from William and Mary.

Software Engineering Institute
 
Carol Woody has been a senior member of the SEI technical staff since 2001. Currently she is the technical manager for the Cyber Security Engineering (CSE) team, whose research focuses on meeting the challenges of cybersecurity in acquisition and in systems and software engineering.
Woody is an experienced technical researcher whose work has focused on government agencies, higher education, and medical organizations. As a consultant for ImageWork Technologies Corp., Woody managed the user testing for CITYTIME, a timekeeping application being developed for New York City. She also consulted with the Queens County District Attorney's Office of New York City to design and implement an electronic document management system. New York City's Administration for Child Services chose her to integrate financial information among state, city, and agency financial systems and also to construct a financial data warehouse and implement web-enabled processes for managing social-service payments. At Yale University, Woody served as architect and implementing project manager for an integrated ID-card solution, developed technical specifications, and assisted users in vendor review and selection for a procurement package, designed and implemented expert-system technology for distributed data collection, and managed a team of technicians supporting the financial operations of the university.
Woody holds a PhD in information science from Nova Southeastern University, an MBA from Wake Forest University, and a BS in mathematics from William and Mary.

Software Engineering Institute
 
Carol Woody has been a senior member of the SEI technical staff since 2001. Currently she is the technical manager for the Cyber Security Engineering (CSE) team, whose research focuses on meeting the challenges of cybersecurity in acquisition and in systems and software engineering.
Woody is an experienced technical researcher whose work has focused on government agencies, higher education, and medical organizations. As a consultant for ImageWork Technologies Corp., Woody managed the user testing for CITYTIME, a timekeeping application being developed for New York City. She also consulted with the Queens County District Attorney's Office of New York City to design and implement an electronic document management system. New York City's Administration for Child Services chose her to integrate financial information among state, city, and agency financial systems and also to construct a financial data warehouse and implement web-enabled processes for managing social-service payments. At Yale University, Woody served as architect and implementing project manager for an integrated ID-card solution, developed technical specifications, and assisted users in vendor review and selection for a procurement package, designed and implemented expert-system technology for distributed data collection, and managed a team of technicians supporting the financial operations of the university.

Software Engineering Institute
 
Carol Woody has been a senior member of the SEI technical staff since 2001. Currently she is the technical manager for the Cyber Security Engineering (CSE) team, whose research focuses on meeting the challenges of cybersecurity in acquisition and in systems and software engineering.
Woody is an experienced technical researcher whose work has focused on government agencies, higher education, and medical organizations. As a consultant for ImageWork Technologies Corp., Woody managed the user testing for CITYTIME, a timekeeping application being developed for New York City. She also consulted with the Queens County District Attorney's Office of New York City to design and implement an electronic document management system. New York City's Administration for Child Services chose her to integrate financial information among state, city, and agency financial systems and also to construct a financial data warehouse and implement web-enabled processes for managing social-service payments. At Yale University, Woody served as architect and implementing project manager for an integrated ID-card solution, developed technical specifications, and assisted users in vendor review and selection for a procurement package, designed and implemented expert-system technology for distributed data collection, and managed a team of technicians supporting the financial operations of the university.

Software Engineering Institute
 
Carol Woody has been a senior member of the SEI technical staff since 2001. Currently she is the technical manager for the Cyber Security Engineering (CSE) team, whose research focuses on meeting the challenges of cybersecurity in acquisition and in systems and software engineering.
Woody is an experienced technical researcher whose work has focused on government agencies, higher education, and medical organizations. As a consultant for ImageWork Technologies Corp., Woody managed the user testing for CITYTIME, a timekeeping application being developed for New York City. She also consulted with the Queens County District Attorney's Office of New York City to design and implement an electronic document management system. New York City's Administration for Child Services chose her to integrate financial information among state, city, and agency financial systems and also to construct a financial data warehouse and implement web-enabled processes for managing social-service payments. At Yale University, Woody served as architect and implementing project manager for an integrated ID-card solution, developed technical specifications, and assisted users in vendor review and selection for a procurement package, designed and implemented expert-system technology for distributed data collection, and managed a team of technicians supporting the financial operations of the university.
