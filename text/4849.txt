 Benefits for Dependents
Benefits-eligible employees may cover their eligible dependents in medical, prescription, dental, vision and life insurance benefits, as well as other benefit programs.
Documentation is required when adding dependents to your coverage. Supporting documentation [pdf] that proves your relationship must be submitted within 30 days of their enrollment date, or they will be removed from your coverage.
Eligible dependents include:
Your spouse or registered domestic partner,
Your children, defined as any one or more of the following:

natural born children
stepchildren
legally-adopted children
children of your registered domestic partner whom you can claim as your dependent on your U.S. federal income tax return for U.S. federal income tax purposes
children for whom you, your spouse or domestic partner serve as legal guardian
children for whom coverage is mandated by a qualified medical child support order

Dependent Children


Age Limit for Children
Children may be covered under the medical, prescription, dental, vision and dependent life insurance benefits until the end of the month of their 26th birthday.
Disabled Dependents
An unmarried dependent child age 26 or older who, except for his or her age, would otherwise qualify for coverage as specified above and who meets all of the following criteria continues to be eligible for coverage:

the child is incapable of self-sustaining employment due to a mental or physical handicap, as certified by a licensed physician;
the child became mentally or physically handicapped prior to age 26; and
the child continues to be claimed as your dependent on your U.S. federal income tax return for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



Domestic Partners


Carnegie Mellon extends benefits to same- and opposite-sex partners of employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. 
For the purpose of receiving coverage under the employee's benefit plans, Carnegie Mellon defines a domestic partnership as a relationship between a Carnegie Mellon employee and another individual that meets the criteria below:

Both parties are 18 years of age or older and are able to contract at time of registration.
Neither party is legally married to nor the domestic partner of any other person.
The parties are not related by blood to a degree that would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The relationship has been entered into voluntarily, willingly and without reservation.
The partners have been in a committed relationship as a couple for at least twelve continuous months prior to registration of the domestic partner relationship. The relationship is intended to continue indefinitely.
The relationship includes mutual support, mutual caring and commitment, and mutual responsibility for each other’s welfare in the nature of a domestic partner relationship.

Registering a Domestic Partnership 
Read the Domestic Partner Registration Packet [pdf]. The packet contains the guidelines regarding eligibility criteria and information about the benefits and tax consequences of Domestic Partner benefits. Take special note of the tax consequences of enrolling a domestic partner who cannot be claimed as a dependent on your federal income tax return. The packet also contains all of the document(s) required to initiate or terminate a partnership and enroll the partner in benefits. The Domestic Partner Registration Packet includes:

Registration Statement of Domestic Partnership for Insurance Benefits
Domestic Partner Certification for Dependent Tax Status
Termination Statement of Domestic Partnership

In addition to the Registration Statement, documentation is required for verification of a domestic partnership. Request registration and provide documentation for a domestic partner through Workday. Provide supporting documentation for at least three of the following circumstances:

Joint lease, deed or mortgage agreement
Designation by the employee of the other party as primary beneficiary on a life insurance policy or retirement contract
Designation of the other party as the primary beneficiary in the employee's will
Durable power of attorney for property or health care issues granted to the other
Joint ownership of a motor vehicle, joint checking account or joint credit account
Mutual legal responsibility for the care of a child

 Benefits for Dependents
Benefits-eligible employees may cover their eligible dependents in medical, prescription, dental, vision and life insurance benefits, as well as other benefit programs.
Documentation is required when adding dependents to your coverage. Supporting documentation [pdf] that proves your relationship must be submitted within 30 days of their enrollment date, or they will be removed from your coverage.
Eligible dependents include:
Your spouse or registered domestic partner,
Your children, defined as any one or more of the following:

natural born children
stepchildren
legally-adopted children
children of your registered domestic partner whom you can claim as your dependent on your U.S. federal income tax return for U.S. federal income tax purposes
children for whom you, your spouse or domestic partner serve as legal guardian
children for whom coverage is mandated by a qualified medical child support order

Dependent Children


Age Limit for Children
Children may be covered under the medical, prescription, dental, vision and dependent life insurance benefits until the end of the month of their 26th birthday.
Disabled Dependents
An unmarried dependent child age 26 or older who, except for his or her age, would otherwise qualify for coverage as specified above and who meets all of the following criteria continues to be eligible for coverage:

the child is incapable of self-sustaining employment due to a mental or physical handicap, as certified by a licensed physician;
the child became mentally or physically handicapped prior to age 26; and
the child continues to be claimed as your dependent on your U.S. federal income tax return for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



Domestic Partners


Carnegie Mellon extends benefits to same- and opposite-sex partners of employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. 
For the purpose of receiving coverage under the employee's benefit plans, Carnegie Mellon defines a domestic partnership as a relationship between a Carnegie Mellon employee and another individual that meets the criteria below:

Both parties are 18 years of age or older and are able to contract at time of registration.
Neither party is legally married to nor the domestic partner of any other person.
The parties are not related by blood to a degree that would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The relationship has been entered into voluntarily, willingly and without reservation.
The partners have been in a committed relationship as a couple for at least twelve continuous months prior to registration of the domestic partner relationship. The relationship is intended to continue indefinitely.
The relationship includes mutual support, mutual caring and commitment, and mutual responsibility for each other’s welfare in the nature of a domestic partner relationship.

Registering a Domestic Partnership 
Read the Domestic Partner Registration Packet [pdf]. The packet contains the guidelines regarding eligibility criteria and information about the benefits and tax consequences of Domestic Partner benefits. Take special note of the tax consequences of enrolling a domestic partner who cannot be claimed as a dependent on your federal income tax return. The packet also contains all of the document(s) required to initiate or terminate a partnership and enroll the partner in benefits. The Domestic Partner Registration Packet includes:

Registration Statement of Domestic Partnership for Insurance Benefits
Domestic Partner Certification for Dependent Tax Status
Termination Statement of Domestic Partnership

 Benefits for Dependents
Benefits-eligible employees may cover their eligible dependents in medical, prescription, dental, vision and life insurance benefits, as well as other benefit programs.
Documentation is required when adding dependents to your coverage. Supporting documentation [pdf] that proves your relationship must be submitted within 30 days of their enrollment date, or they will be removed from your coverage.
Eligible dependents include:
Your spouse or registered domestic partner,
Your children, defined as any one or more of the following:

natural born children
stepchildren
legally-adopted children
children of your registered domestic partner whom you can claim as your dependent on your U.S. federal income tax return for U.S. federal income tax purposes
children for whom you, your spouse or domestic partner serve as legal guardian
children for whom coverage is mandated by a qualified medical child support order

Dependent Children


Age Limit for Children
Children may be covered under the medical, prescription, dental, vision and dependent life insurance benefits until the end of the month of their 26th birthday.
Disabled Dependents
An unmarried dependent child age 26 or older who, except for his or her age, would otherwise qualify for coverage as specified above and who meets all of the following criteria continues to be eligible for coverage:

the child is incapable of self-sustaining employment due to a mental or physical handicap, as certified by a licensed physician;
the child became mentally or physically handicapped prior to age 26; and
the child continues to be claimed as your dependent on your U.S. federal income tax return for U.S. federal income tax purposes.



Domestic Partners


Carnegie Mellon extends benefits to same- and opposite-sex partners of employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. 
For the purpose of receiving coverage under the employee's benefit plans, Carnegie Mellon defines a domestic partnership as a relationship between a Carnegie Mellon employee and another individual that meets the criteria below:

Both parties are 18 years of age or older and are able to contract at time of registration.
Neither party is legally married to nor the domestic partner of any other person.
The parties are not related by blood to a degree that would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
The relationship has been entered into voluntarily, willingly and without reservation.
The partners have been in a committed relationship as a couple for at least twelve continuous months prior to registration of the domestic partner relationship. The relationship is intended to continue indefinitely.
The relationship includes mutual support, mutual caring and commitment, and mutual responsibility for each other’s welfare in the nature of a domestic partner relationship.
