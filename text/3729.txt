 Undergraduate Student Senate
The Carnegie Mellon Undergraduate Student Senate is the undergraduate component of Carnegie Mellon's Student Government Legislative Branch.  We are composed of student-elected representatives that represent the unique and diverse culture of our university. Elected representatives from each Carnegie Mellon college meet on a weekly basis to discuss rising issues on our campus.
To check out our current initiatives and help make a difference, visit our initiatives page. If you're interested in joining Senate (as a Senator or Member-at-Large), check out our get involved page.
Our general body meetings are every Thursday at 5:20pm EST, and are open to everyone in the Carnegie Mellon community. For the Spring 2023 semester, our meeting locations will vary. Please check out our calendar for locations for each meeting. The agenda and minutes for each GBM will be linked there as well.
