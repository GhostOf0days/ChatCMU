 Student Leadership, Involvement, and Civic Engagement (SLICE)
Self-Starters, Do Good-ers and Do Better-ers Unite: You're driven to make a positive impact on humankind. And we're here to support it.

Students can make their mark, channel their passions and shape their involvement through student organizations, leadership opportunities, civic engagement, fraternity and sorority life, CMU's signature traditions and events, and in new ways that are just waiting to be created.
So discover. Explore. Reach deep. Give back. Help others. Celebrate and cheer on. Change the world.
SLICE is here to help, support, advise, mentor and connect you to resources along the way.
