  James R. Swartz Entrepreneurial Fellows
This initiative fast-tracks the careers of Carnegie Mellon University's first year graduate students who are passionate about entrepreneurship in the technology arena.
The highly selective program develops each Fellow's entrepreneurial potential and leadership skills through hands-on experiences, networking, mentoring and courses in entrepreneurship. The program's core is a mentored summer internship with a top-tier VC-backed startup within the high-tech, high-growth environment of California's Silicon Valley and San Francisco  (encouraged but not required) or another area of preference.

Swartz Fellows Alumni


What they say

-Daniel McDade, 2019-20 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('21), Tepper School of Business


"As a Swartz Fellow, I immediately gained a close-knit cohort of entrepreneurially minded graduate students who inspire me. In turn, we have access to the founders and business leaders we aspire to be—and their empathy and willingness to connect remind us that they were in our shoes not so long ago."
-Shana Pradeep, 2018-19 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('20), Tepper School of Business


"Nothing can compare to the on campus experience of being a Swartz Fellow and the unique opportunity to really engage with the greater CMU entrepreneurial ecosystem. Swartz Fellow alumni were instrumental in my Bay Area internship search and are now mentors. "
-Asha Banks, 2018-19 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('20), Tepper School of Business

The program's core is a mentored summer internship with a top-tier VC-backed startup within the high-tech, high-growth environment of California's Silicon Valley and San Francisco  (encouraged but not required) or another area of preference.

What they say

-Daniel McDade, 2019-20 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('21), Tepper School of Business


"As a Swartz Fellow, I immediately gained a close-knit cohort of entrepreneurially minded graduate students who inspire me. In turn, we have access to the founders and business leaders we aspire to be—and their empathy and willingness to connect remind us that they were in our shoes not so long ago."
-Shana Pradeep, 2018-19 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('20), Tepper School of Business


"Nothing can compare to the on campus experience of being a Swartz Fellow and the unique opportunity to really engage with the greater CMU entrepreneurial ecosystem. Swartz Fellow alumni were instrumental in my Bay Area internship search and are now mentors. "
-Asha Banks, 2018-19 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('20), Tepper School of Business

  James R. Swartz Entrepreneurial Fellows
This initiative fast-tracks the careers of Carnegie Mellon University's first year graduate students who are passionate about entrepreneurship in the technology arena.
The highly selective program develops each Fellow's entrepreneurial potential and leadership skills through hands-on experiences, networking, mentoring and courses in entrepreneurship. The program's core is a mentored summer internship with a top-tier VC-backed startup within the high-tech, high-growth environment of California's Silicon Valley and San Francisco  (encouraged but not required) or another area of preference.

What they say

-Daniel McDade, 2019-20 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('21), Tepper School of Business


"As a Swartz Fellow, I immediately gained a close-knit cohort of entrepreneurially minded graduate students who inspire me. In turn, we have access to the founders and business leaders we aspire to be—and their empathy and willingness to connect remind us that they were in our shoes not so long ago."
-Shana Pradeep, 2018-19 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('20), Tepper School of Business


"Nothing can compare to the on campus experience of being a Swartz Fellow and the unique opportunity to really engage with the greater CMU entrepreneurial ecosystem. Swartz Fellow alumni were instrumental in my Bay Area internship search and are now mentors. "
-Asha Banks, 2018-19 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('20), Tepper School of Business

What they say

-Daniel McDade, 2019-20 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('21), Tepper School of Business


"As a Swartz Fellow, I immediately gained a close-knit cohort of entrepreneurially minded graduate students who inspire me. In turn, we have access to the founders and business leaders we aspire to be—and their empathy and willingness to connect remind us that they were in our shoes not so long ago."
-Shana Pradeep, 2018-19 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('20), Tepper School of Business


"Nothing can compare to the on campus experience of being a Swartz Fellow and the unique opportunity to really engage with the greater CMU entrepreneurial ecosystem. Swartz Fellow alumni were instrumental in my Bay Area internship search and are now mentors. "
-Asha Banks, 2018-19 Swartz Fellow, MBA ('20), Tepper School of Business
