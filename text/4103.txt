Jo BodnarKENNETH R. KOEDINGER is a professor of Human Computer Interaction and Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. Dr. Koedinger has an M.S. in Computer Science, a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology, and experience teaching in an urban high school. His multidisciplinary background supports his research goals of understanding human learning and creating educational technologies that increase student achievement. His research has contributed new principles and techniques for the design of educational software and has produced basic cognitive science research results on the nature of student thinking and learning. Koedinger directs LearnLab, which started with 10 years of National Science Foundation funding and is now the scientific arm of CMU’s Simon Initiative. LearnLab builds on the past success of Cognitive Tutors, an approach to online personalized tutoring that is in use in thousands of schools and has been repeatedly demonstrated to increase student achievement, for example, doubling what algebra students learn in a school year. He was a co-founder of CarnegieLearning, Inc. that has brought Cognitive Tutor based courses to millions of students since it was formed in 1998, and leads LearnLab, now the scientific arm of CMU’s Simon Initiative. Dr. Koedinger has authored over 250 peer-reviewed publications and has been a project investigator on over 45 grants. In 2017, he received the Hillman Professorship of Computer Science and in 2018, he was recognized as a fellow of Cognitive Science.Cognitive modeling, intelligent tutoring systems, learning science and technology             Learning science experts from Carnegie Mellon University's Human Computer Interaction Institute (HCII) wanted to know why some students le...

KENNETH R. KOEDINGER is a professor of Human Computer Interaction and Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. Dr. Koedinger has an M.S. in Computer Science, a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology, and experience teaching in an urban high school. His multidisciplinary background supports his research goals of understanding human learning and creating educational technologies that increase student achievement. His research has contributed new principles and techniques for the design of educational software and has produced basic cognitive science research results on the nature of student thinking and learning. Koedinger directs LearnLab, which started with 10 years of National Science Foundation funding and is now the scientific arm of CMU’s Simon Initiative. LearnLab builds on the past success of Cognitive Tutors, an approach to online personalized tutoring that is in use in thousands of schools and has been repeatedly demonstrated to increase student achievement, for example, doubling what algebra students learn in a school year. He was a co-founder of CarnegieLearning, Inc. that has brought Cognitive Tutor based courses to millions of students since it was formed in 1998, and leads LearnLab, now the scientific arm of CMU’s Simon Initiative. Dr. Koedinger has authored over 250 peer-reviewed publications and has been a project investigator on over 45 grants. In 2017, he received the Hillman Professorship of Computer Science and in 2018, he was recognized as a fellow of Cognitive Science.
