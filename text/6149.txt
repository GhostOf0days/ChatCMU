Professor Levin Gives Keynote Lecture and Leads Workshop in Tokyo Art and Technology Event
Posted on February 13, 2023
Professor Golan Levin will give the inaugural keynote lecture at “Future Ideations Camp Vol.1: Import,” a five-day event at Civic Creative Base Tokyo in Shibuya, Tokyo, organized by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and Arts Council. During the event, taking place from February 19 through 23, Levin will also direct a hands-on workshop in computational art and design.
“Future Ideations Camp” is an intensive workshop camp program featuring several days of talks on approaches to art and technology, workshops for developing skill sets, and collaborative creativity through group work. Rooted firmly in the technology and social challenges of today, the camp combines aspects of both debate and co-creation through making things with shared data (which represents the frontline of innovation and trends in art and technology since the 2000s), building a community via collaborative creativity, and seeking out fresh public values.
