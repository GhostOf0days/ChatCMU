They are passionate about so many things and seem to find more hours in the day than the rest of us to pursue those passions. They are looking to become the best version of themselves — in every way. 
Through your support of Make Possible: The Campaign for Carnegie Mellon University, you are ensuring students like these are able to achieve success and be their whole, best selves.  
Enhancing the CMU experience to provide students with the tools, campus environment and support to help them thrive is a key priority for both the university as well as the campaign. In this second issue of Making Possible, our philanthropy impact e-publication, we’ll explore some of the critical initiatives and programs, funded by campaign gifts, that are transforming the Carnegie Mellon student experience. These include the Tartan Scholars program, the under-construction Highmark Center for Health and Wellness, the recently opened Nexus of Civic Engagement and our multidisciplinary maker culture. 








With resources like these, this generation of Tartans is going to change the world — and your philanthropy is making it possible.  








At I write this update, we are 95% of the way to our campaign goal thanks to the generosity of more than 56,000 donors. As chair of both the Board of Trustees and the campaign itself, I remain gratified by how many of you have stepped up to ensure that CMU’s future and the futures of our students are brighter than ever.
The support and dedication of donors like you is moving CMU ever closer to achieving the important aims of this campaign, which will accelerate our momentum as a world leader in education, research, collaboration and innovation. We are so grateful for your investment in today’s — and tomorrow’s — bright students of Carnegie Mellon.
If you have not yet joined the campaign, now is the time to make this journey with us. The impact you create with your support will echo far beyond this moment. Now is the time to make a difference.
On behalf of the entire CMU community, thank you!

Investing in the Student Experience
Issue 02 | Summer 2022


















A golf champion who starts businesses. A future doctor who performs. A humanities scholar who codes. Carnegie Mellon University students aren’t easily classified.








They are passionate about so many things and seem to find more hours in the day than the rest of us to pursue those passions. They are looking to become the best version of themselves — in every way. 
Through your support of Make Possible: The Campaign for Carnegie Mellon University, you are ensuring students like these are able to achieve success and be their whole, best selves.  
Enhancing the CMU experience to provide students with the tools, campus environment and support to help them thrive is a key priority for both the university as well as the campaign. In this second issue of Making Possible, our philanthropy impact e-publication, we’ll explore some of the critical initiatives and programs, funded by campaign gifts, that are transforming the Carnegie Mellon student experience. These include the Tartan Scholars program, the under-construction Highmark Center for Health and Wellness, the recently opened Nexus of Civic Engagement and our multidisciplinary maker culture. 








With resources like these, this generation of Tartans is going to change the world — and your philanthropy is making it possible.  








At I write this update, we are 95% of the way to our campaign goal thanks to the generosity of more than 56,000 donors. As chair of both the Board of Trustees and the campaign itself, I remain gratified by how many of you have stepped up to ensure that CMU’s future and the futures of our students are brighter than ever.
The support and dedication of donors like you is moving CMU ever closer to achieving the important aims of this campaign, which will accelerate our momentum as a world leader in education, research, collaboration and innovation. We are so grateful for your investment in today’s — and tomorrow’s — bright students of Carnegie Mellon.
If you have not yet joined the campaign, now is the time to make this journey with us. The impact you create with your support will echo far beyond this moment. Now is the time to make a difference.
On behalf of the entire CMU community, thank you!

Investing in the Student Experience
Issue 02 | Summer 2022


















A golf champion who starts businesses. A future doctor who performs. A humanities scholar who codes. Carnegie Mellon University students aren’t easily classified.








They are passionate about so many things and seem to find more hours in the day than the rest of us to pursue those passions. They are looking to become the best version of themselves — in every way. 
Through your support of Make Possible: The Campaign for Carnegie Mellon University, you are ensuring students like these are able to achieve success and be their whole, best selves.  
Enhancing the CMU experience to provide students with the tools, campus environment and support to help them thrive is a key priority for both the university as well as the campaign. In this second issue of Making Possible, our philanthropy impact e-publication, we’ll explore some of the critical initiatives and programs, funded by campaign gifts, that are transforming the Carnegie Mellon student experience. These include the Tartan Scholars program, the under-construction Highmark Center for Health and Wellness, the recently opened Nexus of Civic Engagement and our multidisciplinary maker culture. 








With resources like these, this generation of Tartans is going to change the world — and your philanthropy is making it possible.  








At I write this update, we are 95% of the way to our campaign goal thanks to the generosity of more than 56,000 donors. As chair of both the Board of Trustees and the campaign itself, I remain gratified by how many of you have stepped up to ensure that CMU’s future and the futures of our students are brighter than ever.
The support and dedication of donors like you is moving CMU ever closer to achieving the important aims of this campaign, which will accelerate our momentum as a world leader in education, research, collaboration and innovation. We are so grateful for your investment in today’s — and tomorrow’s — bright students of Carnegie Mellon.
If you have not yet joined the campaign, now is the time to make this journey with us. The impact you create with your support will echo far beyond this moment. Now is the time to make a difference.
On behalf of the entire CMU community, thank you!
