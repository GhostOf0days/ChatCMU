It’s a conscious, self-directed and evolving process, meaning you will always be working to create a fulfilling life. The absence of illness or disease doesn’t confirm our wellness, nor does any singular milestone or success. In addition, well-being also means holding what’s happening in our broader culture and recognizing the impact and implications it has on us and our community. We cannot be well when our community is not well. 

Well-being as a state is similar to our learning; we are never finished and there are always new ways to grow, to understand, and to change.
