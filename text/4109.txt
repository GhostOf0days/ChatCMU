KOEDINGER is a professor of Human Computer  Interaction and Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. Dr. Koedinger  has an M.S. in Computer Science, a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology, and  experience teaching in an urban high school. His multidisciplinary  background supports his research goals of understanding human  learning and creating educational technologies that increase student  achievement. His research has contributed new principles and techniques for the  design of educational software and has produced basic cognitive  science research results on the nature of student thinking and learning.
