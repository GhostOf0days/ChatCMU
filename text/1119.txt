 Human Resources Teams
Each department of the university is assigned an HR team. Your HR team should be your first line of contact for any questions or concerns related to Human Resources. Each team includes the following roles:

The recruiter is responsible for recruiting and sourcing talent for staff positions, acting as a partner and advisor to hiring managers.
The HR business partner provides leadership in handling employee relations; performance management; employee engagement; organization design and development; diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; policy interpretation and workforce planning activities.
The HR generalist assists the recruiter and HR business partner in employee relations, performance management, recruitment, policy interpretation and workforce planning activities. This role also serves as a Workday expert, entering and approving department-related transactions as needed.
The compensation manager supports the administration of the university's total compensation program in the areas of job evaluation, career path development, pay practice and compliance.
HR Services is responsible for all onboarding, benefit, audit, and staff hire and termination transactions. HR Services also approves faculty/instructional staff hires and starts international assignments.

Human Resources



 Human Resources Teams
Each department of the university is assigned an HR team. Your HR team should be your first line of contact for any questions or concerns related to Human Resources. Each team includes the following roles:

The recruiter is responsible for recruiting and sourcing talent for staff positions, acting as a partner and advisor to hiring managers.
The HR business partner provides leadership in handling employee relations; performance management; employee engagement; organization design and development; diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; policy interpretation and workforce planning activities.
The HR generalist assists the recruiter and HR business partner in employee relations, performance management, recruitment, policy interpretation and workforce planning activities. This role also serves as a Workday expert, entering and approving department-related transactions as needed.
The compensation manager supports the administration of the university's total compensation program in the areas of job evaluation, career path development, pay practice and compliance.
HR Services is responsible for all onboarding, benefit, audit, and staff hire and termination transactions. HR Services also approves faculty/instructional staff hires and starts international assignments.

 Human Resources Teams
Each department of the university is assigned an HR team. Your HR team should be your first line of contact for any questions or concerns related to Human Resources. Each team includes the following roles:

The recruiter is responsible for recruiting and sourcing talent for staff positions, acting as a partner and advisor to hiring managers.
The HR business partner provides leadership in handling employee relations; performance management; employee engagement; organization design and development; diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; policy interpretation and workforce planning activities.
The HR generalist assists the recruiter and HR business partner in employee relations, performance management, recruitment, policy interpretation and workforce planning activities. This role also serves as a Workday expert, entering and approving department-related transactions as needed.
The compensation manager supports the administration of the university's total compensation program in the areas of job evaluation, career path development, pay practice and compliance.
HR Services is responsible for all onboarding, benefit, audit, and staff hire and termination transactions. HR Services also approves faculty/instructional staff hires and starts international assignments.
