 Welcome to the Student Academic Success Center!
Our work to support success focuses on creating spaces for students to engage in their coursework and approach to learning through many group and individual program options.
We support student success by providing academic coaching, subject-specific tutoring, effective communication strategies, accommodations for students with disabilities, and language support for multilingual learners. We also engage with faculty and with staff to improve the coordination and professional development for academic advisors.
Not sure what program is right for you? Take a look at what we offer below to find out more information. 
Course Support


Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an academic support model that utilizes peer-assisted study sessions. The SI program provides regularly scheduled review sessions on course materials outside the classroom. SI is a non-remedial approach to learning as the program targets high-risk courses and is available in select courses based on data related to past student performance and feasibility.
Peer Tutoring consists of ongoing individualized and small group sessions for students seeking support related to their coursework. You can utilize tutoring to discuss course related content, clarify and ask questions, work through practice problems, etc.
Drop-In Tutoring targets our highest demand courses through regularly scheduled open tutoring sessions during the fall and spring semesters. You are not required to commit to regular attendance, and you can come as needed throughout the semester. You can utilize Drop-In Tutoring to discuss course related content, clarify and ask questions, work through practice problems, and stay to do work.


Skill Building (e.g., Time Management, Organization) 


Academic Coaching provides holistic one-on-one peer support and group workshops to help undergraduate and graduate students find and implement their conditions for success.
Scotty Accountability Sessions Join our Scotty Accountability Sessions to share space and work quietly with other students. Academic coaches will be available to offer help with academic skills if needed.
Academic Coaching Workshops help students improve their time management, productive habits, organization, stress management, and study skills. We collaborate with various graduate and undergraduate programs to offer workshops in a variety of study skills topics. Students can choose to attend one or more workshops that are available year-round.


Communication Support


Communication Support has trained consultants who are ready to help individuals and small groups with any written, verbal, or visual project. If you’re conveying ideas to another person, we’ll help you make sure those ideas are clear and communicated effectively.
