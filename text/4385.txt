In order to use Veterans Education Benefits,you must be an admitted Carnegie Mellon student. Veterans Affairs determines the amount of benefits a student can receive; therefore, we cannot estimate benefit amounts. Please contact the VA at 1-888-442-4551 to find out the amount you are eligible to receive.


The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) determines eligibility and payment amounts for all recipients of Veterans Education Benefits. The University Registrar's Office does not have access to view payment or eligibility information.
All students who receive benefits from the VA must notify the University Registrar's Office each semester so that we can certify your academic enrollment.
Tuition assistance from the Department of Defense is not administered by the VA. The Student Accounts Office handles most tuition assistance inquiries.
For ROTC scholarship/information, please contact CMU's Steel City Naval ROTC unit.
