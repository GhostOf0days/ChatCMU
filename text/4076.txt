Stay up-to-date on upcoming Dietrich College lectures and events. A full listing is available on the Dietrich College Events Calendar.Tuesday, Sept. 5, 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., The Johnstone Room, POS 234  The Center for Early Modern Print, Networks and Performance (CPNP) has returned and is looking forward to offering an exciting line-up of speakers for the coming academic year. We will kick things off with a presentation entitled “Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive” by Carla Nappi professor in the Department of History at the University of Pittsburgh. Nappi is a historian of early modern China with particular expertise in the history of science, translation and pataphysics. She approaches her scholarship as an artistic practice, drawing heavily on her skills as a poet and author of short fiction to vitalize her historical investigations. Reflecting on the pandemic experience and how it offers a rethinking of historical practice, her talk uses a modern encounter with the translation of early modern Manchu-language texts as an opportunity to imagine an insomniac historical craft into being. She will consider how a creative imagination of the archive, of time, and of sleep and its opposites might generate ways to work otherwise with our documents and with storytelling practices based in them.Wednesday, Sept. 6, 1:30 p.m., In Person Focus on Pronunciation is designed to help you improve your pronunciation skills through a series of ongoing weekly practice sessions.

9/5 - Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive

Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive
Tuesday, Sept. 5, 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., The Johnstone Room, POS 234  
The Center for Early Modern Print, Networks and Performance (CPNP) has returned and is looking forward to offering an exciting line-up of speakers for the coming academic year. We will kick things off with a presentation entitled “Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive” by Carla Nappi professor in the Department of History at the University of Pittsburgh. Nappi is a historian of early modern China with particular expertise in the history of science, translation and pataphysics. She approaches her scholarship as an artistic practice, drawing heavily on her skills as a poet and author of short fiction to vitalize her historical investigations. Reflecting on the pandemic experience and how it offers a rethinking of historical practice, her talk uses a modern encounter with the translation of early modern Manchu-language texts as an opportunity to imagine an insomniac historical craft into being. She will consider how a creative imagination of the archive, of time, and of sleep and its opposites might generate ways to work otherwise with our documents and with storytelling practices based in them.

9/8 - Philosophy Colloquium: Homotopy Type Theory

Philosophy Colloquium: Homotopy Type Theory
Friday, Sept. 8, 3:30 to 4:30 p.m., Baker Hall A36 (Adamson Wing) 
Steve Awodey, Carnegie Mellon University
Abstract: A new branch of logic called Homotopy Type Theory was founded in the Philosophy Department at CMU and has flourished there in the intervening 15 years. This talk will survey the historical, philosophical and logical background leading up to the invention of HoTT and trace some of the challenges and advances that have marked its subsequent development. This is a non-technical talk, intended for a general audience.

9/8 - Big Queer Welcome

Big Queer Welcome
Friday, Sept. 8, 4 to 6 p.m., Merson Courtyard, Cohon University Center  
The Big Queer Welcome is open to all CMU undergrads, grads, faculty and staff, researchers and visiting scholars who identify as LGBTQIA+ (or who are an advocate or ally). This LGBTQIA+ welcome for the start of AY 2023-2024 is something that the organizers hope will grow into a recurring practice for the campus community each year.
Join us in celebration and solidarity for some light snacks, refreshments and even a little dancing. We hope to see you in the Merson Courtyard on Sept. 8 from 4-6 p.m. (rain location: the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion).

9/5 - Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive

Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive
Tuesday, Sept. 5, 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., The Johnstone Room, POS 234  
The Center for Early Modern Print, Networks and Performance (CPNP) has returned and is looking forward to offering an exciting line-up of speakers for the coming academic year. We will kick things off with a presentation entitled “Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive” by Carla Nappi professor in the Department of History at the University of Pittsburgh. Nappi is a historian of early modern China with particular expertise in the history of science, translation and pataphysics. She approaches her scholarship as an artistic practice, drawing heavily on her skills as a poet and author of short fiction to vitalize her historical investigations. Reflecting on the pandemic experience and how it offers a rethinking of historical practice, her talk uses a modern encounter with the translation of early modern Manchu-language texts as an opportunity to imagine an insomniac historical craft into being. She will consider how a creative imagination of the archive, of time, and of sleep and its opposites might generate ways to work otherwise with our documents and with storytelling practices based in them.

9/6 - SASC Workshop: Focus on Pronunciation

Philosophy Colloquium: Homotopy Type Theory
Friday, Sept. 8, 3:30 to 4:30 p.m., Baker Hall A36 (Adamson Wing) 
Steve Awodey, Carnegie Mellon University
Abstract: A new branch of logic called Homotopy Type Theory was founded in the Philosophy Department at CMU and has flourished there in the intervening 15 years. This talk will survey the historical, philosophical and logical background leading up to the invention of HoTT and trace some of the challenges and advances that have marked its subsequent development. This is a non-technical talk, intended for a general audience.

Join us in celebration and solidarity for some light snacks, refreshments and even a little dancing. We hope to see you in the Merson Courtyard on Sept. 8 from 4-6 p.m. (rain location: the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion).

We commemorate the tragic events of 9/11 with a lone bagpiper playing at the 9/11 Memorial Tree on the Cut. The Memorial Tree was planted in memory of the seven alumni who perished that day. The piper will play at the moments of impact: 8:46 a.m., 9:03 a.m., 9:37 a.m. and 10:03 a.m., marking the times four airliners crashed into the World Trade Center Towers, the Pentagon and an open field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

9/5 - Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive

Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive
Tuesday, Sept. 5, 4:30 to 6:30 p.m., The Johnstone Room, POS 234  
The Center for Early Modern Print, Networks and Performance (CPNP) has returned and is looking forward to offering an exciting line-up of speakers for the coming academic year. We will kick things off with a presentation entitled “Insomniac History: Sleep, Time and the Archive” by Carla Nappi professor in the Department of History at the University of Pittsburgh. Nappi is a historian of early modern China with particular expertise in the history of science, translation and pataphysics. She approaches her scholarship as an artistic practice, drawing heavily on her skills as a poet and author of short fiction to vitalize her historical investigations. Reflecting on the pandemic experience and how it offers a rethinking of historical practice, her talk uses a modern encounter with the translation of early modern Manchu-language texts as an opportunity to imagine an insomniac historical craft into being. She will consider how a creative imagination of the archive, of time, and of sleep and its opposites might generate ways to work otherwise with our documents and with storytelling practices based in them.

Abstract: A new branch of logic called Homotopy Type Theory was founded in the Philosophy Department at CMU and has flourished there in the intervening 15 years.
