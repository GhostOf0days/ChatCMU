We want to use a hyper-redundant snake-like robot arm to assist a human working in tight spaces on tasks like caulking or pipe assembly. For the safety of the human worker, the actuators on the arm have low torque limits; however, this prevents the arm from cantilevering its entire length. To get around this, our goal is to develop a planner to make the arm brace against the environment. We can then use contact forces to offset the low torque limits, allowing the arm to reach deep into the confined space.ABOUTDiversity, Equity and InclusionHiring Faculty PositionsHistory of the Robotics InstituteMaps, Directions & ParkingRI Branding & IdentityDiversity, Equity and InclusionHiring Faculty PositionsHistory of the Robotics InstituteMaps, Directions & ParkingRI Branding & IdentityPEOPLEAllFacultySpecial FacultyPostdocsStaffInstitute StaffProject StaffStudentsPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesVisitorsAdjunct Faculty and AffiliatesAlumniAllFacultySpecial FacultyPostdocsStaffInstitute StaffProject StaffInstitute StaffProject StaffStudentsPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesVisitorsAdjunct Faculty and AffiliatesAlumniRESEARCHResearchPublicationsCentersLabs & GroupsProjectsRobotsResearchPublicationsCentersLabs & GroupsProjectsRobotsEDUCATIONAcademic ProgramsBachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)CoursesCMU Student ServicesRI Student LifeRI Summer ScholarsAcademic ProgramsBachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)Bachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramAdditional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)CoursesCMU Student ServicesRI Student LifeRI Summer ScholarsNEWSVideosVideosEVENTSAll EventsSeminarsStudent TalksSpecial EventsFaculty EventsStaff EventsRobotics Institute Seminar VideosAll EventsSeminarsStudent TalksSpecial EventsFaculty EventsStaff EventsRobotics Institute Seminar VideosNREC
