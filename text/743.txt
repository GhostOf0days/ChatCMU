Despite the number of such departments around the country, very few prospective students know what electrical and computer engineers do. Electrical and computer engineering integrates many disciplines from electrical engineering and computer science under a common umbrella.Wherever the electrons or computers are—that is where we are.There are four graduate degrees available in the ECE Department:  the Master's of Science and Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Master's of Science in Software Engineering, and the Master's of Science in Artificial Intelligence in Engineering - Electrical and Computer Engineering. Included as part of these degree programs is the ability to complete your studies at various campuses throughout the world.The B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering is a broad and highly flexible degree program structured to provide students with the smallest set of constraints consistent with a rich and comprehensive view of the profession. It is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org/. Students are encouraged and stimulated to explore multiple areas of theory and application.

 Academics
Despite the number of such departments around the country, very few prospective students know what electrical and computer engineers do. Electrical and computer engineering integrates many disciplines from electrical engineering and computer science under a common umbrella.
Wherever the electrons or computers are—that is where we are.
Graduate studies

There are four graduate degrees available in the ECE Department:  the Master's of Science and Ph.D in Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Master's of Science in Software Engineering, and the Master's of Science in Artificial Intelligence in Engineering - Electrical and Computer Engineering. Included as part of these degree programs is the ability to complete your studies at various campuses throughout the world.
