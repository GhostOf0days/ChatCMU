Stop! Contact the Office of Admissions before starting a second application for CMU's Heinz College in the same year. Our admissions process tends to favor students who have clear goals for their graduate study. Submitting more than one application in the same year may serve to reduce the strength of both applications.If you are interested in more than one program of study at CMU's Heinz College, we encourage you to apply to your first choice program (or pathway). In your application, you may mention alternate programs/pathways that interest you in an optional essay. Note: if an applicant is not admitted to the program/pathway to which they applied, they may automatically be considered for alternate programs/pathways that are a better fit at CMU's Heinz College - even if the applicant did not mention alternate interests in the optional essay.
