This is a rigorous graduate program with a substantial workload. It fosters the courage to fail and try again; the integrity and flexibility needed for a collaborative practice; and curiosity, because curious people make better things. It is for the writer who revises relentlessly and the leader who is inventing the theater of a better nation.

Students are encouraged to pursue their professional careers while enrolled in the MFA program, supported by initiatives that provide access to new play development and production opportunities in the field. Graduate students workshop their plays in collaboration with other artists and teach undergraduate courses in playwriting and screenwriting. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Script Competition awards $35,000 each year to current CMU writers for original screenplays and TV pilots. Alumni have access to an established framework of professional connections. 

Guest faculty are a vital presence in the program. Recent guests have included Mojisola Adebayo, Mando Alvarado, Clare Barron, Sheila Callaghan, Eisa Davis, Jessica Dickey, Aleshea Harris, Onalee Hunter Hughes, Aurorae Khoo, Carlos Murillo, Jiehae Park, Cori Thomas, Mfoniso Udofia, and Josh Wilder.

We are committed to an inclusive theater that resists bigotry and oppression. Our community is one of bold artists and bold citizens.

The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Script Competition for the Public Understanding of Science and Technology at Carnegie Mellon University

The Carnegie Mellon University School of Drama is one of six institutions chosen to participate in the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Film School Awards, which presents $35,000 in prizes annually to current students in the Dramatic Writing program at CMU for their original screenplays or television pilots.
The competition encourages the MFA candidates to write scripts that will further the public understanding of science and technology. The Sloan Foundation's goal is to see the resulting scriptsinto commercial production at major studios and networks. To that end, it maintains development programs with the Tribeca, Sundance, and Hamptons film festivals.

Recent prizewinning scripts from the CMU/Sloan Script Competition:
2019
"Love,Genome"
Brandy N. Carie
When hotshot geneticist Maxine is funded to sequence the first complete canine genome, she is confident she can handle the project on her own. Then a stack of administrative work, a teary grad student, and an irritatingly sexy dog breed expert gum up the gears of her well-oiled life. When her beloved dog goes missing Maxine must confront the possibility that this time, she might need a little help.

"Dust to Dust"
Sowmya Ashokkumar
As a child, Divija found her love of space through her father and it became their special language.

"The Friends I Made and The Zombies I Had To Kill To Get Them"
Liz Baker
Every school day, Lu has one goal: survive in order to spend the rest of her time on her favorite zombie-hunting video game. When her stepdad-slash-vice-principal tries to disrupt her lone-wolf habits, she gets drawn into an ethically dubious scheme by her computer-expert crush to win the science fair’s cash prize. However, as the project takes on a life of its own, this  simulation of a zombie-high apocalypse winds up thrusting Lu into the most dangerous red zone of them all: the spotlight of the entire school. 


"Hot Stuff"
D.T. Burns
When domestic terrorists threaten a new geothermal plant, special agent Lucy Ramirez must travel to rural California to protect Natalie Jenkins, the geothermal chemist at the heart of the operation.

"All The Shades of You"
by Lauren D'Errico
Science consultant: Dr. Gabriella Baki, Director of BSPS Cosmetic Science and Formulation Design Major, College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Toledo. A newly unemployed, out-of-vogue chemist must survive the superficial, fast paced world of New York City's makeup industry to return to her modest dream job.

"The Mast Year"
Gillian Beth Durkee
Science consultant: Dr. Walter P. Carson, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Pittsburgh
In leaving behind a troubled childhood and an alcoholic mother, Laura also set aside her dreams of studying trees in favor of a more practical job in the Canadian lumber industry, but her interest in ecology is once again sparked by the possibility that a network of mycorrhizal fungi might exist beneath the forest she oversees. When the death of a beloved aunt leaves Laura’s mother without a caretaker, and Laura’s boss refuses her request to study his trees, Laura decides it might just be time to return home to her mother, the woods of Washington, and the field of study she once loved so fiercely.

"A Glimpse Through The Haze"
 D.T. Burns
cience consultant: Dr. Vera S. Donnenberg, Associate Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hillman Cancer Center, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

Daniel Hirsch
Dr. Pete Woolinsky studies so-called “gay sheep.” More accurately, his research focuses on hormonal processes that correlate with male-oriented breeding behavior and physiological differentiation in domesticated rams. However, accuracy gets thrown out the window when drunk college kids kidnap one of his sheep subjects and a media frenzy ensues. The subsequent public backlash to Pete’s research unites PETA, conservative talk radio hosts, LGBTQ bloggers, and even members of his own family. Inspired by true events, Sheepish tells a story about the delicate business of studying sexuality in a politically rambunctious age.

"Percy Spencer and the Radarange"

However, when her parents ban electricity because it's bad for the environment and her best friend gets a different partner for the science fair, her only hope for winning the science fair— and getting a hot veggie burger— is a willingness to compromise and the possibility that her biomethane generator can turn plants and poop into sustainable energy.

Based on the life of tech pioneer Robert Noyce, Traitorous depicts the birth of a new industry, the tumultuous transformation of a community, and the break-ups and betrayals that preceded one of the 20th Century’s most important technological breakthroughs: the microchip.
