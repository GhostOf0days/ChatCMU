The School of Computer Science offers a wide range of professional and academic Ph.D. and master's programs across its seven departments. Admissions and requirements vary by program, and are determined by the program's home department. Below you will find a variety of frequently asked questions about our application process.If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you ("native language" meaning spoken at home and from birth), we are required to formally evaluate your English proficiency.We require applicants who will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and for whom English is not a native language, to demonstrate English proficiency via one of these standardized tests: TOEFL (preferred), IELTS or Duolingo. We discourage the use of the "TOEFL ITP Plus for China", since speaking is not scored. We do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English. In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college or university. We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college or university outside of the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver.NOTE: Unfortunately, previous studies at a U.S. high school, college or university are NOT grounds for a language-test waiver. Also, previous studies at a non-U.S. English-language-instruction high school, college or university are NOT grounds for a language-test waiver.The SCS Graduate Application Support Program is a student-led initiative to offer feedback to potential applicants, particularly those from underrepresented groups. Learn more and apply to be matched with a mentor. Early Deadline: November 29, 2023   (3 p.m. EST)Final Deadline: December 13, 2023   (3 p.m. EST)GRE Report Codes:TOEFL Report Codes:EducationEducation Overview of Programs

We prefer that your recommenders submit their letters by the application deadline, but it is ok if they arrive a few days late. Is there spring admission?Most of our programs only have a fall admission. See our Graduate Admissions Overview page for exceptions.If I applied last year and was not admitted, can I reapply this year?Yes. However, you must complete a new application and upload all application materials again.Should I contact faculty members directly?You are free to contact professors with specific questions about their research. However, we request that you not ask to be accepted by a particular faculty member as a student, since under our admissions system individual faculty members do not make admissions decisions. Selection is made by the Admissions Committee, and students are not assigned an advisor until the beginning of the fall semester. This happens after students have an opportunity to attend project presentations by all faculty.You may obtain email addresses for anyone in the School of Computer Science from the directory.  What is my User ID? Your user ID is the email address that you use to login to the application.Note that this email address will be used for all correspondence from us and for your letter of notification. Make certain that it will be valid through the following year. Financial Aid and Application FeesAre there additional financial aid forms to complete?No.Will I be considered for financial support if I am admitted into a master's program?No, master's programs generally do not offer financial aid.Will I be considered for financial support if I am admitted into a Ph.D. program?Yes. Ph.D. students will receive financial support (tuition, fees, monthly stipend) from a variety of sources, including CMU research assistantships, outside fellowships and government grants (e.g., NSF or other government institutions). Students are encouraged to apply for outside funding and fellowships; research assistantships are available for students without their own funding.What if I cannot afford to pay the application fee?We expect all applicants to submit payment with their online application. However, we do waive the required fee under certain circumstances. Fees for application to a limited number of our programs can be waived for participants in certain programs. In addition, if you are unable to pay the application fee, SCS will consider a fee waiver request. Visit the SCS Fee Waivers page for more information.How can I pay the application fee?You must pay the fee by credit card. We do not accept cash or check.I submitted my application payment, but it is not working. What can I do? If your application payment is unsuccessful for any reason, the payment page will automatically reset so that the payment button will reappear.

What do I select under Residency Status?Select the one that will most closely match your status when you arrive on campus.What should I provide as my current address?Use the address where you will be available to receive mail through April. You may enter a permanent address if it differs from your current address. Do NOT enter a PO Box. The acceptance packets are sent by express mail (e.g., FedEx, UPS), and cannot be delivered to a PO Box.Test Scores: TOEFL, IELTS, Duolingo, GRE, and GMATIf you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you ("native language" meaning spoken at home and from birth), we are required to formally evaluate your English proficiency.We require applicants who will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and for whom English is not a native language, to demonstrate English proficiency via one of these standardized tests: TOEFL (preferred), IELTS or Duolingo. We discourage the use of the "TOEFL ITP Plus for China", since speaking is not scored. We do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English. In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college or university. We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college or university outside of the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver.NOTE: Unfortunately, previous studies at a U.S. high school, college or university are NOT grounds for a language-test waiver. Also, previous studies at a non-U.S. English-language-instruction high school, college or university are NOT grounds for a language-test waiver.I plan to take the TOEFL, IELTS and/or GRE in either November or December. However, the score will not be reported until after the final deadline. What should I do?If you need to retake your TOEFL, IELTS and/or GRE for this application, we highly recommend you take the exam no later than Nov. 29, 2023.

However, space is provided for you to submit up to five. No more than five will be accepted.Who should I ask to write letters of recommendation for me?The admissions committee wants to know about your ability to do independent research, so you should select letter writers who can best speak to that point.Professors who interacted with you extensively in smaller classes are also a good choice.Employers are sometimes appropriate, but letters that are simply character references will not provide good support for your application.At least two recommendation letters should be from faculty or recent employers.If I submit my application before the early deadline, do my recommenders also need to submit early?No they don't. If you submit your application early your recommenders still have until the final deadline to submit recommendations.Master's ProgramsHow long does it take to complete a master’s program?About 1-2 years.Is it possible to work on a master’s degree part time?Most of our programs require that you be here full time.Can I transfer into a master’s program from another college/university?You may not simply transfer to a program.
