Events & Public ProgramsJoin us for what's nextEvents ArchiveThe Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture (SoA) is pleased to announce the opening of EX-CHANGE, our annual showcase of student work.The 2023 EX-CHANGE celebrates projects from first year through PhD programs through an exhibition in the College of Fine Arts (CFA) Great Hall on view from August 28-September 10, 2023. During the 2022-23 school year, the SoA facilitated discussions around the concept of materiality through public programs and advanced studios, with an emphasis on aesthetics in the fall and extractivism in the spring semesters. In the exhibitions of student work on campus this fall, materiality guides the placement of student projects. A landscape of models fills the Great Hall from August 28-September 10, 2023.On Friday, September 8, 2023, from 5–8pm, the Carnegie Mellon Architecture will host a Welcome Back Celebration in the CFA Great Hall, featuring tours of the exhibition at 4:30pm. The 2023 EX-CHANGE catalog will be available in both print and digital editions. The SoA gratefully acknowledges our 2023 sponsors who have helped make this project possible: 2023 SPONSORSPERKINS EASTMANStrada | Design With People In Mind®TitleCONTAINMENT, CARE + COMMUNITY DatesTuesday, Sept. 5–Sunday, Sept. 10Location Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 123 & 124  Containment, Care + Community showcases work from earlier and more recent periods of pandemic life exploring social and spatial prospects for preventing contagion, providing care, and building community. The artists, designers, and scholars represented in this exhibition examine the intersections of disease and space as historically-situated, unevenly experienced, and productive of different possibilities. They underscore the urgency of radical care and health justice given the ongoing social, health, and economic impacts of the pandemic. Rather than seeing containment, care, and community as distinct concepts, the exhibition invites viewers to consider how methods of infectious disease containment may open avenues, not for isolation and personal responsibility, but for relationality and collective action. TeamNida Rehman, Curator and Project Director Ilana Curtis, Exhibition DesignerMorgan Newman, Research + Design AssistantImportant DatesSep 5 2023 - 12.30-2pm: Open house reception with curator and exhibition designer Sep 7 2023 - Borderlines –> Hospitality: a migratory CAS event (contact CAS for details)Sep 8 2023: School of Architecture EXCHANGE party! On Friday, September 8, 2023, from 5-8:00pm, the SoA will host a Welcome Back Celebration in the CFA Great Hall, featuring tours of the EX-CHANGE exhibition at 4:00pm.

Occupant feedback is often solicited with surveys about their perception ‘right here, right now’. However, spending so much time as we do inside buildings, (90-95% of time in the US), the impact of indoor conditions should also be evaluated over the long term. The biophilia hypothesis prescribes connecting building occupants to the outdoors for their well-being. Well-being goes beyond momentary satisfaction to long-term health and productivity. To investigate the applicability of the biophilia hypothesis to thermal conditioning, this dissertation compared short and long-term benefits of the two main thermal conditioning approaches – steady state, with fixed temperature setpoints, and natural ventilation, with variable temperatures similar to the outdoors.To test the hypothesis and identify the impact of natural conditioning on occupant well-being, health and productivity, an experiment was developed and conducted to compare the impact of the two thermal conditioning approaches on the participants. The experiment was conducted in Kampala, Uganda, with fifty-nine recent university graduates. Participants were exposed to one week of natural ventilation and one week of air conditioning. Seven short- and long-term participant outcomes were measured and analyzed: thermal perception, sleep quality, resting heart rate, sedentary time, sick building syndrome, mood and reaction time to online tests.Results of the research indicated multiple benefits of naturally ventilated buildings. Participants reported more comfort and fewer incidents of sick building syndrome in the natural ventilation week. Women participants were disproportionately disadvantaged by the air-conditioned week. Contrary to expectation, resting heart rate was lower in the air-conditioned week. Sleep quality, sedentary time, mood and reaction time outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the two weeks. Indoor pollutants like Carbon Dioxide, Total Volatile Organic Compounds and Particulate Matter (PM2.5) were higher during the air-conditioning week because of lower air change rates. The research findings identified that natural ventilation in mild climates like Kampala is a net advantage to building occupants. Additionally, temperate climates where outdoor conditions exceed the comfort thresholds for much of the year, can also benefit from natural ventilation in the milder seasons. Where mechanical thermal conditioning is inevitable, setpoints need not be static since they could map the variability of outdoors while keeping within the comfort thresholds. Link to Thesis DocumentCarnegie Mellon University is closed on Monday, 04 September 2023 in observance of the Labor Day Holiday.The fall 2023 semester at Carnegie Mellon University begins on Monday, 28 August 2023.Join us for the 2023 Architectural Ceramic Assemblies Workshop (ACAW) Symposium on Thursday, August 17 at 12:00pm (EST) followed by a closing keynote from Orel Samson, Senior Manager – Construction, Allied Properties REIT.Now in its eighth year, the ACAW is the paramount venue for innovation in architectural terra cotta.

Prototyping and making largely help develop the understanding concept of joinery/material behavior, and properties in relation to form. The exercise allows understanding chair as a piece of furniture, the manner of making that gives qualities to an abstract design or idea, the know-how of handling material, emergence of tacit knowledge in the maker, and tolerance and feedback from the material.Coordinators: Vicky AchnaniPlease join us to celebrate the opening of the 2023 SoA Thesis Exhibition.The 2023 SoA Thesis Exhibition will be on view from May 5–May 14, 2022 at the Pittsburgh Athletic Association, 4215 Fifth Avenue.

The Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture (SoA) is pleased to announce the opening of EX-CHANGE, our annual showcase of student work.The 2023 EX-CHANGE celebrates projects from first year through PhD programs through an exhibition in the College of Fine Arts (CFA) Great Hall on view from August 28-September 10, 2023. During the 2022-23 school year, the SoA facilitated discussions around the concept of materiality through public programs and advanced studios, with an emphasis on aesthetics in the fall and extractivism in the spring semesters. In the exhibitions of student work on campus this fall, materiality guides the placement of student projects. A landscape of models fills the Great Hall from August 28-September 10, 2023.On Friday, September 8, 2023, from 5–8pm, the Carnegie Mellon Architecture will host a Welcome Back Celebration in the CFA Great Hall, featuring tours of the exhibition at 4:30pm. The 2023 EX-CHANGE catalog will be available in both print and digital editions.

TitleCONTAINMENT, CARE + COMMUNITY DatesTuesday, Sept. 5–Sunday, Sept. 10Location Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 123 & 124  Containment, Care + Community showcases work from earlier and more recent periods of pandemic life exploring social and spatial prospects for preventing contagion, providing care, and building community. The artists, designers, and scholars represented in this exhibition examine the intersections of disease and space as historically-situated, unevenly experienced, and productive of different possibilities. They underscore the urgency of radical care and health justice given the ongoing social, health, and economic impacts of the pandemic. Rather than seeing containment, care, and community as distinct concepts, the exhibition invites viewers to consider how methods of infectious disease containment may open avenues, not for isolation and personal responsibility, but for relationality and collective action. TeamNida Rehman, Curator and Project Director Ilana Curtis, Exhibition DesignerMorgan Newman, Research + Design AssistantImportant DatesSep 5 2023 - 12.30-2pm: Open house reception with curator and exhibition designer Sep 7 2023 - Borderlines –> Hospitality: a migratory CAS event (contact CAS for details)Sep 8 2023: School of Architecture EXCHANGE party!

Title: The impact of dynamic thermal conditions on the health and productivity of building occupantsName: James Katungyi, PhD Candidate in Building Performance & DiagnosticsDate: Wednesday, September 6, 2023Time: 2:00-4:00pm ETLocation: Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall (MMCH), Room 107 and on Zoom



 Advisory Committee:Vivian Loftness, FAIA (Chair)University ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Evyatar Erell, PhD ProfessorBen Gurion University of the NegevDr. Erica Cochran Hameen, PhDDirector DEI, Assistant ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Anne Germain, PhDFounder & CEO NOCTEM HEALTH; formerly ProfessorUniversity of PittsburghAbstract:Much of the effort to improve indoor thermal conditions for building occupants is focused on meeting the comfort needs of the moment. Occupant feedback is often solicited with surveys about their perception ‘right here, right now’. However, spending so much time as we do inside buildings, (90-95% of time in the US), the impact of indoor conditions should also be evaluated over the long term. The biophilia hypothesis prescribes connecting building occupants to the outdoors for their well-being. Well-being goes beyond momentary satisfaction to long-term health and productivity. To investigate the applicability of the biophilia hypothesis to thermal conditioning, this dissertation compared short and long-term benefits of the two main thermal conditioning approaches – steady state, with fixed temperature setpoints, and natural ventilation, with variable temperatures similar to the outdoors.To test the hypothesis and identify the impact of natural conditioning on occupant well-being, health and productivity, an experiment was developed and conducted to compare the impact of the two thermal conditioning approaches on the participants. The experiment was conducted in Kampala, Uganda, with fifty-nine recent university graduates. Participants were exposed to one week of natural ventilation and one week of air conditioning. Seven short- and long-term participant outcomes were measured and analyzed: thermal perception, sleep quality, resting heart rate, sedentary time, sick building syndrome, mood and reaction time to online tests.Results of the research indicated multiple benefits of naturally ventilated buildings. Participants reported more comfort and fewer incidents of sick building syndrome in the natural ventilation week. Women participants were disproportionately disadvantaged by the air-conditioned week. Contrary to expectation, resting heart rate was lower in the air-conditioned week. Sleep quality, sedentary time, mood and reaction time outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the two weeks. Indoor pollutants like Carbon Dioxide, Total Volatile Organic Compounds and Particulate Matter (PM2.5) were higher during the air-conditioning week because of lower air change rates. The research findings identified that natural ventilation in mild climates like Kampala is a net advantage to building occupants. Additionally, temperate climates where outdoor conditions exceed the comfort thresholds for much of the year, can also benefit from natural ventilation in the milder seasons. Where mechanical thermal conditioning is inevitable, setpoints need not be static since they could map the variability of outdoors while keeping within the comfort thresholds. Link to Thesis Document

The exercise of making a chair can be a grounds for experimentation and learning to shape the material into the desired object. Prototyping and making largely help develop the understanding concept of joinery/material behavior, and properties in relation to form. The exercise allows understanding chair as a piece of furniture, the manner of making that gives qualities to an abstract design or idea, the know-how of handling material, emergence of tacit knowledge in the maker, and tolerance and feedback from the material.Coordinators: Vicky Achnani

The Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture (SoA) is pleased to announce the opening of EX-CHANGE, our annual showcase of student work.The 2023 EX-CHANGE celebrates projects from first year through PhD programs through an exhibition in the College of Fine Arts (CFA) Great Hall on view from August 28-September 10, 2023. During the 2022-23 school year, the SoA facilitated discussions around the concept of materiality through public programs and advanced studios, with an emphasis on aesthetics in the fall and extractivism in the spring semesters. In the exhibitions of student work on campus this fall, materiality guides the placement of student projects. A landscape of models fills the Great Hall from August 28-September 10, 2023.On Friday, September 8, 2023, from 5–8pm, the Carnegie Mellon Architecture will host a Welcome Back Celebration in the CFA Great Hall, featuring tours of the exhibition at 4:30pm. The 2023 EX-CHANGE catalog will be available in both print and digital editions.

TitleCONTAINMENT, CARE + COMMUNITY DatesTuesday, Sept. 5–Sunday, Sept. 10Location Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 123 & 124  Containment, Care + Community showcases work from earlier and more recent periods of pandemic life exploring social and spatial prospects for preventing contagion, providing care, and building community. The artists, designers, and scholars represented in this exhibition examine the intersections of disease and space as historically-situated, unevenly experienced, and productive of different possibilities. They underscore the urgency of radical care and health justice given the ongoing social, health, and economic impacts of the pandemic. Rather than seeing containment, care, and community as distinct concepts, the exhibition invites viewers to consider how methods of infectious disease containment may open avenues, not for isolation and personal responsibility, but for relationality and collective action. TeamNida Rehman, Curator and Project Director Ilana Curtis, Exhibition DesignerMorgan Newman, Research + Design AssistantImportant DatesSep 5 2023 - 12.30-2pm: Open house reception with curator and exhibition designer Sep 7 2023 - Borderlines –> Hospitality: a migratory CAS event (contact CAS for details)Sep 8 2023: School of Architecture EXCHANGE party!

Title: The impact of dynamic thermal conditions on the health and productivity of building occupantsName: James Katungyi, PhD Candidate in Building Performance & DiagnosticsDate: Wednesday, September 6, 2023Time: 2:00-4:00pm ETLocation: Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall (MMCH), Room 107 and on Zoom



 Advisory Committee:Vivian Loftness, FAIA (Chair)University ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Evyatar Erell, PhD ProfessorBen Gurion University of the NegevDr. Erica Cochran Hameen, PhDDirector DEI, Assistant ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Anne Germain, PhDFounder & CEO NOCTEM HEALTH; formerly ProfessorUniversity of PittsburghAbstract:Much of the effort to improve indoor thermal conditions for building occupants is focused on meeting the comfort needs of the moment. Occupant feedback is often solicited with surveys about their perception ‘right here, right now’. However, spending so much time as we do inside buildings, (90-95% of time in the US), the impact of indoor conditions should also be evaluated over the long term. The biophilia hypothesis prescribes connecting building occupants to the outdoors for their well-being. Well-being goes beyond momentary satisfaction to long-term health and productivity. To investigate the applicability of the biophilia hypothesis to thermal conditioning, this dissertation compared short and long-term benefits of the two main thermal conditioning approaches – steady state, with fixed temperature setpoints, and natural ventilation, with variable temperatures similar to the outdoors.To test the hypothesis and identify the impact of natural conditioning on occupant well-being, health and productivity, an experiment was developed and conducted to compare the impact of the two thermal conditioning approaches on the participants. The experiment was conducted in Kampala, Uganda, with fifty-nine recent university graduates. Participants were exposed to one week of natural ventilation and one week of air conditioning. Seven short- and long-term participant outcomes were measured and analyzed: thermal perception, sleep quality, resting heart rate, sedentary time, sick building syndrome, mood and reaction time to online tests.Results of the research indicated multiple benefits of naturally ventilated buildings. Participants reported more comfort and fewer incidents of sick building syndrome in the natural ventilation week. Women participants were disproportionately disadvantaged by the air-conditioned week. Contrary to expectation, resting heart rate was lower in the air-conditioned week. Sleep quality, sedentary time, mood and reaction time outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the two weeks. Indoor pollutants like Carbon Dioxide, Total Volatile Organic Compounds and Particulate Matter (PM2.5) were higher during the air-conditioning week because of lower air change rates. The research findings identified that natural ventilation in mild climates like Kampala is a net advantage to building occupants. Additionally, temperate climates where outdoor conditions exceed the comfort thresholds for much of the year, can also benefit from natural ventilation in the milder seasons. Where mechanical thermal conditioning is inevitable, setpoints need not be static since they could map the variability of outdoors while keeping within the comfort thresholds. Link to Thesis Document

The exercise of making a chair can be a grounds for experimentation and learning to shape the material into the desired object. Prototyping and making largely help develop the understanding concept of joinery/material behavior, and properties in relation to form. The exercise allows understanding chair as a piece of furniture, the manner of making that gives qualities to an abstract design or idea, the know-how of handling material, emergence of tacit knowledge in the maker, and tolerance and feedback from the material.Coordinators: Vicky Achnani

TitleCONTAINMENT, CARE + COMMUNITY DatesTuesday, Sept. 5–Sunday, Sept. 10Location Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 123 & 124  Containment, Care + Community showcases work from earlier and more recent periods of pandemic life exploring social and spatial prospects for preventing contagion, providing care, and building community. The artists, designers, and scholars represented in this exhibition examine the intersections of disease and space as historically-situated, unevenly experienced, and productive of different possibilities. They underscore the urgency of radical care and health justice given the ongoing social, health, and economic impacts of the pandemic. Rather than seeing containment, care, and community as distinct concepts, the exhibition invites viewers to consider how methods of infectious disease containment may open avenues, not for isolation and personal responsibility, but for relationality and collective action. TeamNida Rehman, Curator and Project Director Ilana Curtis, Exhibition DesignerMorgan Newman, Research + Design AssistantImportant DatesSep 5 2023 - 12.30-2pm: Open house reception with curator and exhibition designer Sep 7 2023 - Borderlines –> Hospitality: a migratory CAS event (contact CAS for details)Sep 8 2023: School of Architecture EXCHANGE party!

Title: The impact of dynamic thermal conditions on the health and productivity of building occupantsName: James Katungyi, PhD Candidate in Building Performance & DiagnosticsDate: Wednesday, September 6, 2023Time: 2:00-4:00pm ETLocation: Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall (MMCH), Room 107 and on Zoom



 Advisory Committee:Vivian Loftness, FAIA (Chair)University ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Evyatar Erell, PhD ProfessorBen Gurion University of the NegevDr. Erica Cochran Hameen, PhDDirector DEI, Assistant ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Anne Germain, PhDFounder & CEO NOCTEM HEALTH; formerly ProfessorUniversity of PittsburghAbstract:Much of the effort to improve indoor thermal conditions for building occupants is focused on meeting the comfort needs of the moment. Occupant feedback is often solicited with surveys about their perception ‘right here, right now’. However, spending so much time as we do inside buildings, (90-95% of time in the US), the impact of indoor conditions should also be evaluated over the long term. The biophilia hypothesis prescribes connecting building occupants to the outdoors for their well-being. Well-being goes beyond momentary satisfaction to long-term health and productivity. To investigate the applicability of the biophilia hypothesis to thermal conditioning, this dissertation compared short and long-term benefits of the two main thermal conditioning approaches – steady state, with fixed temperature setpoints, and natural ventilation, with variable temperatures similar to the outdoors.To test the hypothesis and identify the impact of natural conditioning on occupant well-being, health and productivity, an experiment was developed and conducted to compare the impact of the two thermal conditioning approaches on the participants. The experiment was conducted in Kampala, Uganda, with fifty-nine recent university graduates. Participants were exposed to one week of natural ventilation and one week of air conditioning. Seven short- and long-term participant outcomes were measured and analyzed: thermal perception, sleep quality, resting heart rate, sedentary time, sick building syndrome, mood and reaction time to online tests.Results of the research indicated multiple benefits of naturally ventilated buildings. Participants reported more comfort and fewer incidents of sick building syndrome in the natural ventilation week. Women participants were disproportionately disadvantaged by the air-conditioned week. Contrary to expectation, resting heart rate was lower in the air-conditioned week. Sleep quality, sedentary time, mood and reaction time outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the two weeks. Indoor pollutants like Carbon Dioxide, Total Volatile Organic Compounds and Particulate Matter (PM2.5) were higher during the air-conditioning week because of lower air change rates. The research findings identified that natural ventilation in mild climates like Kampala is a net advantage to building occupants. Additionally, temperate climates where outdoor conditions exceed the comfort thresholds for much of the year, can also benefit from natural ventilation in the milder seasons. Where mechanical thermal conditioning is inevitable, setpoints need not be static since they could map the variability of outdoors while keeping within the comfort thresholds. Link to Thesis Document

The exercise of making a chair can be a grounds for experimentation and learning to shape the material into the desired object. Prototyping and making largely help develop the understanding concept of joinery/material behavior, and properties in relation to form. The exercise allows understanding chair as a piece of furniture, the manner of making that gives qualities to an abstract design or idea, the know-how of handling material, emergence of tacit knowledge in the maker, and tolerance and feedback from the material.Coordinators: Vicky Achnani

During the 2022-23 school year, the SoA facilitated discussions around the concept of materiality through public programs and advanced studios, with an emphasis on aesthetics in the fall and extractivism in the spring semesters. In the exhibitions of student work on campus this fall, materiality guides the placement of student projects. A landscape of models fills the Great Hall from August 28-September 10, 2023.On Friday, September 8, 2023, from 5–8pm, the Carnegie Mellon Architecture will host a Welcome Back Celebration in the CFA Great Hall, featuring tours of the exhibition at 4:30pm.

TitleCONTAINMENT, CARE + COMMUNITY DatesTuesday, Sept. 5–Sunday, Sept. 10Location Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 123 & 124  Containment, Care + Community showcases work from earlier and more recent periods of pandemic life exploring social and spatial prospects for preventing contagion, providing care, and building community. The artists, designers, and scholars represented in this exhibition examine the intersections of disease and space as historically-situated, unevenly experienced, and productive of different possibilities. They underscore the urgency of radical care and health justice given the ongoing social, health, and economic impacts of the pandemic. Rather than seeing containment, care, and community as distinct concepts, the exhibition invites viewers to consider how methods of infectious disease containment may open avenues, not for isolation and personal responsibility, but for relationality and collective action. TeamNida Rehman, Curator and Project Director Ilana Curtis, Exhibition DesignerMorgan Newman, Research + Design AssistantImportant DatesSep 5 2023 - 12.30-2pm: Open house reception with curator and exhibition designer Sep 7 2023 - Borderlines –> Hospitality: a migratory CAS event (contact CAS for details)Sep 8 2023: School of Architecture EXCHANGE party!

TitleCONTAINMENT, CARE + COMMUNITY DatesTuesday, Sept. 5–Sunday, Sept. 10Location Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall 123 & 124  Containment, Care + Community showcases work from earlier and more recent periods of pandemic life exploring social and spatial prospects for preventing contagion, providing care, and building community. The artists, designers, and scholars represented in this exhibition examine the intersections of disease and space as historically-situated, unevenly experienced, and productive of different possibilities. They underscore the urgency of radical care and health justice given the ongoing social, health, and economic impacts of the pandemic. Rather than seeing containment, care, and community as distinct concepts, the exhibition invites viewers to consider how methods of infectious disease containment may open avenues, not for isolation and personal responsibility, but for relationality and collective action. TeamNida Rehman, Curator and Project Director Ilana Curtis, Exhibition DesignerMorgan Newman, Research + Design AssistantImportant DatesSep 5 2023 - 12.30-2pm: Open house reception with curator and exhibition designer Sep 7 2023 - Borderlines –> Hospitality: a migratory CAS event (contact CAS for details)Sep 8 2023: School of Architecture EXCHANGE party!

Title: The impact of dynamic thermal conditions on the health and productivity of building occupantsName: James Katungyi, PhD Candidate in Building Performance & DiagnosticsDate: Wednesday, September 6, 2023Time: 2:00-4:00pm ETLocation: Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall (MMCH), Room 107 and on Zoom



 Advisory Committee:Vivian Loftness, FAIA (Chair)University ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Evyatar Erell, PhD ProfessorBen Gurion University of the NegevDr. Erica Cochran Hameen, PhDDirector DEI, Assistant ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Anne Germain, PhDFounder & CEO NOCTEM HEALTH; formerly ProfessorUniversity of PittsburghAbstract:Much of the effort to improve indoor thermal conditions for building occupants is focused on meeting the comfort needs of the moment. Occupant feedback is often solicited with surveys about their perception ‘right here, right now’. However, spending so much time as we do inside buildings, (90-95% of time in the US), the impact of indoor conditions should also be evaluated over the long term. The biophilia hypothesis prescribes connecting building occupants to the outdoors for their well-being. Well-being goes beyond momentary satisfaction to long-term health and productivity. To investigate the applicability of the biophilia hypothesis to thermal conditioning, this dissertation compared short and long-term benefits of the two main thermal conditioning approaches – steady state, with fixed temperature setpoints, and natural ventilation, with variable temperatures similar to the outdoors.To test the hypothesis and identify the impact of natural conditioning on occupant well-being, health and productivity, an experiment was developed and conducted to compare the impact of the two thermal conditioning approaches on the participants. The experiment was conducted in Kampala, Uganda, with fifty-nine recent university graduates. Participants were exposed to one week of natural ventilation and one week of air conditioning. Seven short- and long-term participant outcomes were measured and analyzed: thermal perception, sleep quality, resting heart rate, sedentary time, sick building syndrome, mood and reaction time to online tests.Results of the research indicated multiple benefits of naturally ventilated buildings. Participants reported more comfort and fewer incidents of sick building syndrome in the natural ventilation week. Women participants were disproportionately disadvantaged by the air-conditioned week. Contrary to expectation, resting heart rate was lower in the air-conditioned week. Sleep quality, sedentary time, mood and reaction time outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the two weeks. Indoor pollutants like Carbon Dioxide, Total Volatile Organic Compounds and Particulate Matter (PM2.5) were higher during the air-conditioning week because of lower air change rates. The research findings identified that natural ventilation in mild climates like Kampala is a net advantage to building occupants. Additionally, temperate climates where outdoor conditions exceed the comfort thresholds for much of the year, can also benefit from natural ventilation in the milder seasons. Where mechanical thermal conditioning is inevitable, setpoints need not be static since they could map the variability of outdoors while keeping within the comfort thresholds. Link to Thesis Document

Presentations will share design studies ten months in the making from eight professional teams who have developed terra cotta solutions for a variety of architectural applications.ACAW is a collaborative workshop that brings together industry professionals and academia in the field of architecture. Hosted by Boston Valley Terra Cotta, in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture and the University at Buffalo School of Architecture and Planning, ACAW aims to enhance the understanding of terra cotta as a building material and its role in shaping future architectural designs. By engaging architects, façade engineers, educators, and students, ACAW fosters knowledge sharing and hands-on experience in the development of terra cotta wall assemblies. The ACAW 2023 Symposium, held on August 17, 2023, celebrates the conclusion of the annual event with a live project showcase of teams’ presentations and panel discussions of their visual prototype terra cotta assemblies.ACAW PARTICIPATING TEAMS:Eric Parry Architects + FMDC Ltd.

The exercise of making a chair can be a grounds for experimentation and learning to shape the material into the desired object. Prototyping and making largely help develop the understanding concept of joinery/material behavior, and properties in relation to form. The exercise allows understanding chair as a piece of furniture, the manner of making that gives qualities to an abstract design or idea, the know-how of handling material, emergence of tacit knowledge in the maker, and tolerance and feedback from the material.Coordinators: Vicky Achnani

Title: The impact of dynamic thermal conditions on the health and productivity of building occupantsName: James Katungyi, PhD Candidate in Building Performance & DiagnosticsDate: Wednesday, September 6, 2023Time: 2:00-4:00pm ETLocation: Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall (MMCH), Room 107 and on Zoom



 Advisory Committee:Vivian Loftness, FAIA (Chair)University ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Evyatar Erell, PhD ProfessorBen Gurion University of the NegevDr. Erica Cochran Hameen, PhDDirector DEI, Assistant ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Anne Germain, PhDFounder & CEO NOCTEM HEALTH; formerly ProfessorUniversity of PittsburghAbstract:Much of the effort to improve indoor thermal conditions for building occupants is focused on meeting the comfort needs of the moment. Occupant feedback is often solicited with surveys about their perception ‘right here, right now’. However, spending so much time as we do inside buildings, (90-95% of time in the US), the impact of indoor conditions should also be evaluated over the long term. The biophilia hypothesis prescribes connecting building occupants to the outdoors for their well-being. Well-being goes beyond momentary satisfaction to long-term health and productivity. To investigate the applicability of the biophilia hypothesis to thermal conditioning, this dissertation compared short and long-term benefits of the two main thermal conditioning approaches – steady state, with fixed temperature setpoints, and natural ventilation, with variable temperatures similar to the outdoors.To test the hypothesis and identify the impact of natural conditioning on occupant well-being, health and productivity, an experiment was developed and conducted to compare the impact of the two thermal conditioning approaches on the participants. The experiment was conducted in Kampala, Uganda, with fifty-nine recent university graduates. Participants were exposed to one week of natural ventilation and one week of air conditioning. Seven short- and long-term participant outcomes were measured and analyzed: thermal perception, sleep quality, resting heart rate, sedentary time, sick building syndrome, mood and reaction time to online tests.Results of the research indicated multiple benefits of naturally ventilated buildings. Participants reported more comfort and fewer incidents of sick building syndrome in the natural ventilation week. Women participants were disproportionately disadvantaged by the air-conditioned week. Contrary to expectation, resting heart rate was lower in the air-conditioned week. Sleep quality, sedentary time, mood and reaction time outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the two weeks. Indoor pollutants like Carbon Dioxide, Total Volatile Organic Compounds and Particulate Matter (PM2.5) were higher during the air-conditioning week because of lower air change rates. The research findings identified that natural ventilation in mild climates like Kampala is a net advantage to building occupants. Additionally, temperate climates where outdoor conditions exceed the comfort thresholds for much of the year, can also benefit from natural ventilation in the milder seasons. Where mechanical thermal conditioning is inevitable, setpoints need not be static since they could map the variability of outdoors while keeping within the comfort thresholds. Link to Thesis Document

Title: The impact of dynamic thermal conditions on the health and productivity of building occupantsName: James Katungyi, PhD Candidate in Building Performance & DiagnosticsDate: Wednesday, September 6, 2023Time: 2:00-4:00pm ETLocation: Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall (MMCH), Room 107 and on Zoom



 Advisory Committee:Vivian Loftness, FAIA (Chair)University ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Evyatar Erell, PhD ProfessorBen Gurion University of the NegevDr. Erica Cochran Hameen, PhDDirector DEI, Assistant ProfessorSchool of Architecture, Carnegie Mellon University  Anne Germain, PhDFounder & CEO NOCTEM HEALTH; formerly ProfessorUniversity of PittsburghAbstract:Much of the effort to improve indoor thermal conditions for building occupants is focused on meeting the comfort needs of the moment. Occupant feedback is often solicited with surveys about their perception ‘right here, right now’. However, spending so much time as we do inside buildings, (90-95% of time in the US), the impact of indoor conditions should also be evaluated over the long term. The biophilia hypothesis prescribes connecting building occupants to the outdoors for their well-being. Well-being goes beyond momentary satisfaction to long-term health and productivity. To investigate the applicability of the biophilia hypothesis to thermal conditioning, this dissertation compared short and long-term benefits of the two main thermal conditioning approaches – steady state, with fixed temperature setpoints, and natural ventilation, with variable temperatures similar to the outdoors.To test the hypothesis and identify the impact of natural conditioning on occupant well-being, health and productivity, an experiment was developed and conducted to compare the impact of the two thermal conditioning approaches on the participants. The experiment was conducted in Kampala, Uganda, with fifty-nine recent university graduates. Participants were exposed to one week of natural ventilation and one week of air conditioning. Seven short- and long-term participant outcomes were measured and analyzed: thermal perception, sleep quality, resting heart rate, sedentary time, sick building syndrome, mood and reaction time to online tests.Results of the research indicated multiple benefits of naturally ventilated buildings. Participants reported more comfort and fewer incidents of sick building syndrome in the natural ventilation week. Women participants were disproportionately disadvantaged by the air-conditioned week. Contrary to expectation, resting heart rate was lower in the air-conditioned week. Sleep quality, sedentary time, mood and reaction time outcomes showed no statistically significant differences between the two weeks. Indoor pollutants like Carbon Dioxide, Total Volatile Organic Compounds and Particulate Matter (PM2.5) were higher during the air-conditioning week because of lower air change rates. The research findings identified that natural ventilation in mild climates like Kampala is a net advantage to building occupants. Additionally, temperate climates where outdoor conditions exceed the comfort thresholds for much of the year, can also benefit from natural ventilation in the milder seasons. Where mechanical thermal conditioning is inevitable, setpoints need not be static since they could map the variability of outdoors while keeping within the comfort thresholds. Link to Thesis Document

The exercise of making a chair can be a grounds for experimentation and learning to shape the material into the desired object. Prototyping and making largely help develop the understanding concept of joinery/material behavior, and properties in relation to form. The exercise allows understanding chair as a piece of furniture, the manner of making that gives qualities to an abstract design or idea, the know-how of handling material, emergence of tacit knowledge in the maker, and tolerance and feedback from the material.Coordinators: Vicky Achnani

The studio, “Past Futures: The American Rust Belt - Architecture, Environment and Aesthetics through Speculative Fictions,” will ask: How will the aesthetics of the background reality in the Rust Belt be altered in the next two decades? How do the variables in the past affect future conditions: social, political, ecological? How do these conditions affect typology, scale, and tectonics? We will consider these relationships as potential moments for discovery and innovation.Coordinators: Heather BizonThis review will be follows the review which will be held from 12:30-4:30pm in CFA 214.
