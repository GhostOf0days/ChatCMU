In doing so, she offers an innovative and critical use of the developing medium, without being tempted by its technological refinements.

Inbar Hagai MFA ’24 Receives Young Artist Award from the Israeli Ministry of Culture and Sport
Posted on August 30, 2023
MFA candidate Inbar Hagai is the winner of the Young Artist Award from the Israeli Ministry of Culture and Sport.
The judging committee noted: “Inbar Hagai mainly uses virtual reality. Her complex works allow the viewer a phenomenological viewing experience that unfolds in a sophisticated manner on horizontal and vertical axes and combines images related to sexuality, femininity, and technology. Hagai incorporates her own image or biographical elements into the works and treats virtual reality as an installation medium that fuses together the external and internal reality, for their aesthetic and political implications. In doing so, she offers an innovative and critical use of the developing medium, without being tempted by its technological refinements. (translated from Hebrew)
