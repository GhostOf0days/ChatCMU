PhD in Literary and Cultural StudiesMy research focuses on 20th and 21st century media, visual culture, and literature in the Americas with attention to conceptions of race, mobility, and the law. My dissertation, “Mediating Documentation: Race, Affective Governance, and the US/Mexico Border,” traces documentary media’s representations of migration and surveillance cultures inthe borderlands. I analyze documentary forms such as film, photography, and television series that self-reflexively bolster or call into question state processes of documentation.Research Keywords: Media, Critical Border Studies, Migration, Visual Culture

Bio

My research focuses on 20th and 21st century media, visual culture, and literature in the Americas with attention to conceptions of race, mobility, and the law. My dissertation, “Mediating Documentation: Race, Affective Governance, and the US/Mexico Border,” traces documentary media’s representations of migration and surveillance cultures inthe borderlands. I analyze documentary forms such as film, photography, and television series that self-reflexively bolster or call into question state processes of documentation.Research Keywords: Media, Critical Border Studies, Migration, Visual Culture

PhD in Literary and Cultural Studies
Bio

My research focuses on 20th and 21st century media, visual culture, and literature in the Americas with attention to conceptions of race, mobility, and the law. My dissertation, “Mediating Documentation: Race, Affective Governance, and the US/Mexico Border,” traces documentary media’s representations of migration and surveillance cultures inthe borderlands. I analyze documentary forms such as film, photography, and television series that self-reflexively bolster or call into question state processes of documentation.Research Keywords: Media, Critical Border Studies, Migration, Visual Culture

PhD in Literary and Cultural Studies
Bio

My research focuses on 20th and 21st century media, visual culture, and literature in the Americas with attention to conceptions of race, mobility, and the law. My dissertation, “Mediating Documentation: Race, Affective Governance, and the US/Mexico Border,” traces documentary media’s representations of migration and surveillance cultures inthe borderlands. I analyze documentary forms such as film, photography, and television series that self-reflexively bolster or call into question state processes of documentation.Research Keywords: Media, Critical Border Studies, Migration, Visual Culture
