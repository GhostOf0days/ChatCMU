Approved entrepreneurs who are still working on exploring their entrepreneurship idea or are in the early stages of their startup are welcome to use any of the available first-come first-served tables.
They also have 24-hour access to the space and are able to request reservations for the Project Olympus conference rooms.

Computer Monitors for All

Enjoy more Screen Real Estate for those projects that require you to view multiple things at once. 

Dedicated Tables


Entrepreneurs who have demonstrated significant progress and commitment to their startup through their work at Project Olympus are assigned a dedicated space.
Dedicated spaces are clearly marked with the startups logo and/or name and are reserved for use only by that startup.

Offices


Use of one of the six Project Olympus offices is reserved for the entrepreneurs who have shown the most progress, commitment, and dedication to their startup.
Offices are assigned by the Project Olympus Access Committee and are reviewed on a semester basis.

Approved entrepreneurs who are still working on exploring their entrepreneurship idea or are in the early stages of their startup are welcome to use any of the available first-come first-served tables.
They also have 24-hour access to the space and are able to request reservations for the Project Olympus conference rooms.

Computer Monitors for All
 

Over ten double-monitor stations for everyone to use! We provide all of the cords, you just need to plug and play. 
Enjoy more Screen Real Estate for those projects that require you to view multiple things at once. 

Dedicated Tables


Entrepreneurs who have demonstrated significant progress and commitment to their startup through their work at Project Olympus are assigned a dedicated space.
Dedicated spaces are clearly marked with the startups logo and/or name and are reserved for use only by that startup.

Offices


Use of one of the six Project Olympus offices is reserved for the entrepreneurs who have shown the most progress, commitment, and dedication to their startup.
Offices are assigned by the Project Olympus Access Committee and are reviewed on a semester basis.
