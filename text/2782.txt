                      Prasad, Brian Zhang45% homework, 20% midterm, 30% course project, 5% participation This course provides a broad perspective on AI, covering (i) classical approaches of search and planning
          useful for robotics, (ii) integer programming and continuous optimization that form the bedrock for many AI
          algorithms, (iii) modern machine learning techniques including deep learning that power many recent AI
          applications, (iv) game theory and multi-agent systems, and (v) issues of bias and unfairness in AI. In
          addition to understanding the theoretical foundations, we will also study modern algorithms in the research
          literature.
        There are no formal pre-requisites for the course, but students should have previous programming experience
          (programming assignments will be given in Python), as well as some general CS background. Please see the
          instructors if you are unsure whether your background is suitable for the course. There will be five assignments: they will involve both written answers and programming assignments. Written
          questions will involve working through algorithms presented in the class, deriving and proving mathematical
          results, and critically analyzing the material presented in class. Programming assignments will involve
          writing code in Python to implement various algorithms presented in class. Instructions for submitting homework will be added soon.
        You can use no more than 3 late days per assignment and no more than a total of 8 late days
              over the semester. These late days can and should be used in the event that something comes up that you
              did not plan for. You do not need to notify the course staff if you plan to use them. No credit will be
              given for assignments submitted more than 3 days (72 hours) after the posted deadline.You can discuss both the programming and written portions with other students, but all final submitted
                work (code and writeups) must be done entirely on your own, without looking at any notes generated
                during group discussions. Be sure to mention your collaborators' names and Andrew IDs in your
                writeup.Can search the internet for references but you are not allowed to post the questions on stackoverflow or
              anywhere else.If you reference any code or sources other than the materials provided on the course website or the
              textbook, you must mention the source. If you have any questions about whether or not you can use a
              source, please ask.The course project can be done in groups of 1-3. If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage
          you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with
          you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability
          and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we
          encourage you to visit their website.Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
          getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with
          stress. 
          All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus
          and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner
          rather than later is almost always helpful.
          If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
          depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to
          help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend,
          faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
          If you have questions about this or your coursework, please let us know. Thank you, and have a great semester.
        We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is
          fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to
          multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language,
          sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status,
          or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the
          perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity,
          equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue
          justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our
          classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core
          values.
          Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.
          Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They
          contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the
          university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity
          to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed.
          Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.
          Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to
          be more equitable and just.

          questions will involve working through algorithms presented in the class, deriving and proving mathematical
          results, and critically analyzing the material presented in class. Programming assignments will involve
          writing code in Python to implement various algorithms presented in class. 
Instructions for submitting homework will be added soon.
        
Homework Policies


You can use no more than 3 late days per assignment and no more than a total of 8 late days
              over the semester. These late days can and should be used in the event that something comes up that you
              did not plan for. You do not need to notify the course staff if you plan to use them. No credit will be
              given for assignments submitted more than 3 days (72 hours) after the posted deadline.


You can discuss both the programming and written portions with other students, but all final submitted
                work (code and writeups) must be done entirely on your own, without looking at any notes generated
                during group discussions. Be sure to mention your collaborators' names and Andrew IDs in your
                writeup.


Can search the internet for references but you are not allowed to post the questions on stackoverflow or
              anywhere else.

If you reference any code or sources other than the materials provided on the course website or the
              textbook, you must mention the source. If you have any questions about whether or not you can use a
              source, please ask.




Course project
The course project can be done in groups of 1-3. 



Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage
          you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with
          you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability
          and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we
          encourage you to visit their website.
Statement of Support for Studentsâ Health & Well-being
Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
          getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with
          stress.

Homework Assignments
There will be five assignments: they will involve both written answers and programming assignments. Written
          questions will involve working through algorithms presented in the class, deriving and proving mathematical
          results, and critically analyzing the material presented in class. Programming assignments will involve
          writing code in Python to implement various algorithms presented in class. 
Instructions for submitting homework will be added soon.
        
Homework Policies


You can use no more than 3 late days per assignment and no more than a total of 8 late days
              over the semester. These late days can and should be used in the event that something comes up that you
              did not plan for. You do not need to notify the course staff if you plan to use them. No credit will be
              given for assignments submitted more than 3 days (72 hours) after the posted deadline.


You can discuss both the programming and written portions with other students, but all final submitted
                work (code and writeups) must be done entirely on your own, without looking at any notes generated
                during group discussions. Be sure to mention your collaborators' names and Andrew IDs in your
                writeup.


Can search the internet for references but you are not allowed to post the questions on stackoverflow or
              anywhere else.

If you reference any code or sources other than the materials provided on the course website or the
              textbook, you must mention the source. If you have any questions about whether or not you can use a
              source, please ask.




Course project
The course project can be done in groups of 1-3. 



Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, we encourage
          you to discuss your accommodations and needs with us as early in the semester as possible. We will work with
          you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability
          and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, we
          encourage you to visit their website.
Statement of Support for Studentsâ Health & Well-being
Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising,
          getting enough sleep, and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with
          stress. 
          All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available on campus
          and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner
          rather than later is almost always helpful.
          If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or
          depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to
          help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/. Consider reaching out to a friend,
          faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
          If you have questions about this or your coursework, please let us know. Thank you, and have a great semester.
        
Statement of Commitment to a Diverse Learning Environment
We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is
          fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to
          multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language,
          sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status,
          or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the
          perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity,
          equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue
          justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our
          classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core
          values.
          Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.
          Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They
          contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the
          university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity
          to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed.
          Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:

 Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
           Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net
            username: tartans password: plaid
        
All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions.
          Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to
          be more equitable and just.

 This course provides a broad perspective on AI, covering (i) classical approaches of search and planning
          useful for robotics, (ii) integer programming and continuous optimization that form the bedrock for many AI
          algorithms, (iii) modern machine learning techniques including deep learning that power many recent AI
          applications, (iv) game theory and multi-agent systems, and (v) issues of bias and unfairness in AI. In
          addition to understanding the theoretical foundations, we will also study modern algorithms in the research
          literature.
        
 Prerequisites 
There are no formal pre-requisites for the course, but students should have previous programming experience
          (programming assignments will be given in Python), as well as some general CS background. Please see the
          instructors if you are unsure whether your background is suitable for the course.
