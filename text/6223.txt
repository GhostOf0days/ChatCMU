Professor Rubin’s Work Included in New Thames & Hudson Survey of Contemporary Painting
Posted on May 14, 2021
Professor Jon Rubin‘s project, “Fruit and Other Things,” created with Lenka Clayton for the Carnegie International, was included in the recent Thames and Hudson publication, Contemporary Painting (World of Art).
Painting is a continually expanding and evolving medium. The radical changes that have taken place since the 1960s and 1970s – including the shift from modernism to postmodernism – have been accompanied by fierce debates regarding the place of painting in contemporary culture, and have led to its reinvigoration as a practice, lending it an energy and excitement that persist today. Renowned critic and art historian Suzanne Hudson offers an intelligent and original survey of the subject, exploring the ways in which the medium is being approached, re-imagined and challenged by contemporary artists.
