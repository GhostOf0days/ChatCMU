In the Creative Writing program, undergraduate students will develop talents in writing fiction, poetry, screenwriting, and creative nonfiction. While studying with faculty members who are writers, Creative Writing majors will read a wide range of literature and genres, sharpen critical and verbal skills, better explore the resources and potential of imagination, and develop a professional attitude towards writing. The extracurricular writing activities and a variety of writing internships available on and off campus provide valuable experiences for planning both professional and academic futures.  After graduation, many Creative Writing majors go on to graduate writing programs and to careers in teaching, publishing, public relations, advertising, TV and film, or freelance writing and editing.Declare Creative WritingQuestions?

 Creative Writing Program
Carnegie Mellon University houses one of a small number of English departments in the country offering a major in Creative Writing.

In the Creative Writing program, undergraduate students will develop talents in writing fiction, poetry, screenwriting, and creative nonfiction. While studying with faculty members who are writers, Creative Writing majors will read a wide range of literature and genres, sharpen critical and verbal skills, better explore the resources and potential of imagination, and develop a professional attitude towards writing. The extracurricular writing activities and a variety of writing internships available on and off campus provide valuable experiences for planning both professional and academic futures.  After graduation, many Creative Writing majors go on to graduate writing programs and to careers in teaching, publishing, public relations, advertising, TV and film, or freelance writing and editing.

 Creative Writing Program
Carnegie Mellon University houses one of a small number of English departments in the country offering a major in Creative Writing.

In the Creative Writing program, undergraduate students will develop talents in writing fiction, poetry, screenwriting, and creative nonfiction. While studying with faculty members who are writers, Creative Writing majors will read a wide range of literature and genres, sharpen critical and verbal skills, better explore the resources and potential of imagination, and develop a professional attitude towards writing. The extracurricular writing activities and a variety of writing internships available on and off campus provide valuable experiences for planning both professional and academic futures.  After graduation, many Creative Writing majors go on to graduate writing programs and to careers in teaching, publishing, public relations, advertising, TV and film, or freelance writing and editing.

In the Creative Writing program, undergraduate students will develop talents in writing fiction, poetry, screenwriting, and creative nonfiction. While studying with faculty members who are writers, Creative Writing majors will read a wide range of literature and genres, sharpen critical and verbal skills, better explore the resources and potential of imagination, and develop a professional attitude towards writing. The extracurricular writing activities and a variety of writing internships available on and off campus provide valuable experiences for planning both professional and academic futures.  After graduation, many Creative Writing majors go on to graduate writing programs and to careers in teaching, publishing, public relations, advertising, TV and film, or freelance writing and editing.
