Optimizing Strategies for Learners with Dyslexia


 A leader of transformative advances in neural sciences
As the birthplace of artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology, CMU brain scientists have had real-world impact for over 50 years.
From the creation of some of the first cognitive tutors, to the development of the Jeopardy-winning Watson, to founding a ground-breaking doctoral program in neural computation, to recent cutting-edge work on the genetic basis of autism, Carnegie Mellon has been, and will continue to be, a leader in the study of brain and behavior.
And our expertise doesn't stop at technology. World-renowned faculty such as Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, John Anderson and Raj Reddy all helped shape modern cognitive psychology.
At the same time, seminal collaborations between psychologists and computer scientists gave rise to the field of artificial intelligence.
Today, partnerships between CMU neuroscientists, psychologists, statisticians, computer scientists and engineers leave us poised to make similar groundbreaking accomplishments.
