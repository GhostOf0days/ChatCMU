Rebecca Shapass MFA ’23 Screens Work in Film Diary NYC
Posted on November 13, 2022
Rebecca Shapass‘ film “ROYGBIV (before the end, the lights shine bright)” will be screened in the second edition of Film Diary NYC, a festival of diary films, home movies, and personal documentaries taking place at multiple independent cinema venues across New York City from November 12-19. Shapass’ film will open the program “Ghost With Skin” at Millenium Film Workshop (Brooklyn, NY) on November 16.
A meditative portrait of blue hour & the urban constructions that frame it, “ROYGBIV (before the end, the lights shine bright)” observes modes of connective and enforced time-keeping through human-made infrastructures gridding the sky & ground such as street lights, trains, and electrical cabling. Through rhythmic editing and a score built from harmonizing vocalizations with the hum of electrical transducers, the film contemplates the ways in which human interventions create, harmonize with, and disrupt the cycles of the earth’s rotation and the way living beings exist within it.
