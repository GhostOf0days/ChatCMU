 Carnegie Mellon Absence From Campus Request
An Absence From Campus (AFC) Request is required to be submitted online each time a student wants to leave campus in any of the following circumstances:


For an extended period of time that is over 4 hours

Overnight
In a private vehicle (i.e., a vehicle not affiliated with Pre-College Programs)

Absence From Campus Procedure:

The AFC Request must be completed 48 hours in advance of a student’s planned departure.
Once the request has been submitted, a residential staff member will contact the student’s parent/guardian by telephone to verify the proposed absence. If the student’s parent/guardian is not reachable, the absence will not be approved.
Upon confirmation of the absence, both the student and the parent/guardian will be notified by the Community Advisor through email with any further instructions or updates necessary.

Absence From Campus Policies:

In the event of an emergency, any AFC Request submitted after the 48-hour window will need to be approved and verified by the Assistant Director for Student Affairs.
This request may not be used as a method to be late for curfew. Students may not enter or exit the residential buildings during curfew hours. There are no exceptions to this policy.
The supervising adult listed on your AFC Request must be a parent/guardian who is at least 21 years or older.
If a student's parent/guardian does not answer the call from our staff and approve the absence, the request will be denied.
If a student has a medical emergency during curfew hours, the Pre-College staff will accompany them to the appropriate medical facility and an AFC Request is not required.
If a student misses a class, it will be their responsibility to contact their academic director and instructors of the program to coordinate making up any work that will be missed.

Frequently Asked Questions
When should I submit an AFC Request?

                Requests should be submitted 48 hours prior to leaving campus. This gives our staff ample opportunity to review the requests, reach out to parents/guardians, make any approvals or rejections, and send confirmations. Please Note: Any requests that are submitted late and are not an emergency situation may not be approved.

Can I tell my RA/CA or teacher that I will be absent, but not submit an AFC Request?

No. All students are required to submit an AFC Request to ensure their safety and that all proper parties know that they will not be on campus. Any student that leaves campus without submitting an AFC Request and having that AFC Request approved will be subject to disciplinary action.
However, students are responsible for telling their teachers if they will be missing any class time or assignments while they are away from campus.

Can my parents call the school instead of me submitting an AFC Request?

                No. We need a completed AFC Request in order to approve the absence. Parents/guardians will need to be called to confirm.
            
My parents are coming for a weekend. Do I need an AFC Request to leave campus with them?

Yes. The need for advanced permission applies to anyone (including the student’s parents/guardians and other family members) who will accompany the student off-campus for an extended period of time or transport the student in a private vehicle. This is our only way to keep track of whether we should be expecting to see students on campus or checking them in for curfew.

Can someone other than my parents/guardians approve my AFC Request?

                No. Only parents/guardians who are legally responsible for the student and are on the Emergency Response Form can approve an AFC Request.
            
Who should I follow up with on my AFC Request?

                If a student has not gotten a confirmation on their AFC Request, they should reach out to their dorm's Community Advisor (CA) for further information and instruction.
            
If I need to leave campus on a regular basis (e.g., weekly doctor appointment), do I need to submit the AFC Request every time?

Yes. A separate AFC Request is required for each absence. Blanket permission requests are not acceptable.

My family will be here all weekend. Do I need a separate AFC Request each time I leave with them?

Yes. A separate AFC Request is required for each absence. Blanket permission requests are not acceptable.

My sibling lives in Pittsburgh. Do I need an AFC Request if they are driving me somewhere (e.g., doctor's appointment, dinner)?

Yes. An AFC Request is required for each absence including riding in a private vehicle.

Someone under 21 is driving through Pittsburgh. Can they pick me up to go off-campus?

No. The person who accompanies the student off-campus or transports the student in a private vehicle must be a responsible adult at least 21 years old.

Submit this Absence From Campus Request at least 48 hours prior to the planned absence.

Upon confirmation of the absence, both the student and the parent/guardian will be notified by the Community Advisor through email with any further instructions or updates necessary.

Absence From Campus Policies:

In the event of an emergency, any AFC Request submitted after the 48-hour window will need to be approved and verified by the Assistant Director for Student Affairs.
This request may not be used as a method to be late for curfew. Students may not enter or exit the residential buildings during curfew hours. There are no exceptions to this policy.
The supervising adult listed on your AFC Request must be a parent/guardian who is at least 21 years or older.
If a student's parent/guardian does not answer the call from our staff and approve the absence, the request will be denied.
If a student has a medical emergency during curfew hours, the Pre-College staff will accompany them to the appropriate medical facility and an AFC Request is not required.
If a student misses a class, it will be their responsibility to contact their academic director and instructors of the program to coordinate making up any work that will be missed.

Frequently Asked Questions
When should I submit an AFC Request?

                Requests should be submitted 48 hours prior to leaving campus. This gives our staff ample opportunity to review the requests, reach out to parents/guardians, make any approvals or rejections, and send confirmations. Please Note: Any requests that are submitted late and are not an emergency situation may not be approved.

Can I tell my RA/CA or teacher that I will be absent, but not submit an AFC Request?

No. All students are required to submit an AFC Request to ensure their safety and that all proper parties know that they will not be on campus. Any student that leaves campus without submitting an AFC Request and having that AFC Request approved will be subject to disciplinary action.
However, students are responsible for telling their teachers if they will be missing any class time or assignments while they are away from campus.

Can my parents call the school instead of me submitting an AFC Request?

                No. We need a completed AFC Request in order to approve the absence. Parents/guardians will need to be called to confirm.
            
My parents are coming for a weekend. Do I need an AFC Request to leave campus with them?

Yes. The need for advanced permission applies to anyone (including the student’s parents/guardians and other family members) who will accompany the student off-campus for an extended period of time or transport the student in a private vehicle. This is our only way to keep track of whether we should be expecting to see students on campus or checking them in for curfew.

Can someone other than my parents/guardians approve my AFC Request?

                No. Only parents/guardians who are legally responsible for the student and are on the Emergency Response Form can approve an AFC Request.
            
Who should I follow up with on my AFC Request?

                If a student has not gotten a confirmation on their AFC Request, they should reach out to their dorm's Community Advisor (CA) for further information and instruction.
            
If I need to leave campus on a regular basis (e.g., weekly doctor appointment), do I need to submit the AFC Request every time?

Yes. A separate AFC Request is required for each absence. Blanket permission requests are not acceptable.

My family will be here all weekend. Do I need a separate AFC Request each time I leave with them?

Yes. A separate AFC Request is required for each absence. Blanket permission requests are not acceptable.

My sibling lives in Pittsburgh. Do I need an AFC Request if they are driving me somewhere (e.g., doctor's appointment, dinner)?

Yes. An AFC Request is required for each absence including riding in a private vehicle.

Someone under 21 is driving through Pittsburgh. Can they pick me up to go off-campus?

No. The person who accompanies the student off-campus or transports the student in a private vehicle must be a responsible adult at least 21 years old.
