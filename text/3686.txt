ADVANCING THE FUTURE OF SCIENCE




 Transforming scientific discovery for a new age
Science is in the midst of a rapid transformation — one that CMU is uniquely positioned to lead with our commitment to limitless collaboration and complementary strengths in the foundational sciences, computation, engineering and data analytics.
The decade-long initiative to revolutionize the future of science will accelerate the university’s leadership in scientific discovery and education and lead to groundbreaking innovations that will benefit all of humankind. The future of science initiative will provide opportunities for scientists across the university’s seven schools and colleges and promote interdisciplinary collaboration. 
 The future of science initiative includes: 

The construction of a next-generation Richard King Mellon Hall of Sciences on the Pittsburgh campus that will be designed and built with flexibility in mind, allowing labs to be configured and reconfigured to encourage collaboration and to quickly mobilize to answer emerging problems. Classrooms, teaching labs and other spaces will be created with the intention of inspiring students and preparing them to become future scientists and leaders.
A focus on research of the future that will empower powerful cross-disciplinary teams to focus on emerging areas with the potential for worldchanging breakthroughs. These collaborations will tear down intellectual and physical barriers between disciplines when asking — and answering — critical questions in key areas. 
The Carnegie Mellon University Cloud Lab — a shared, remote-controlled, artificial intelligence-driven robotic facility — that will accelerate the speed of scientific discovery, spur collaboration in the scientific process and democratize science by removing the limitations of cost and availability of scientific equipment for both those inside Carnegie Mellon and the broader scientific community.

 
With your support, we will transform scientific discovery and education for the 21st century, using our strengths in the foundational sciences, engineering, and computer and data sciences to make groundbreaking innovations that will benefit all of humankind.
