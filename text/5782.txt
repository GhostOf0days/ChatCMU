StudentsWho We Really AreUndergraduate Students Masters & PhD StudentsOur students have disparate perspectives, backgrounds, and goals; they break any and every mold. Though every School of Architecture student graduates with intensive architecture knowledge, no two graduates leave with the same education. In the twenty-first century, few architecture problems are straightforward. School of Architecture graduates excel in the roles architects have performed for centuries—and in new roles catalyzed by the depth and breadth of their education—to create and execute innovative solutions to a wide range of emerging global challenges.Note: Clicking on the profile images below will take you out of the School of Architecture’s website and into students' self-curated online portfolios, which are entirely under their own jurisdiction. Profiles are provided at each student's discretion, therefore not all current students are listed.Gabrielle BensonB.Arch 2024Jai BhatnagarB.Arch 2024Rebecca CunninghamB.Arch 2024Sharon FungB.Arch 2024Brian HartmanB.Arch 2024Howie LiB.Arch 2024Brenna RobinsonB.Arch 2024Tory TanB.Arch 2024Colin WaltersB.Arch 2024Isabel XuB.Arch 2024Dunn (Qiyuan) ZhangB.Arch 2024Jerry (Yonghao) ZhangB.Arch 2024Jamie Espinosa-BrionesB.A. 2024Vanshika BhaiyaB.Arch 2025Neha ChopraB.Arch 2025Taehyun (Edward) LimB.Arch 2025Graham MurthaB.Arch 2025Henry von RintelenB.Arch 2025Aidan SmithB.Arch 2025Akanksha TayalB.Arch 2025Hazel FrolingB.Arch 2026Paul (Keng Pu) LiB.Arch 2026Ella MaxwellB.Arch 2026Shahzadi PaddaB.Arch 2026Madelyn Isabella Salazar HarperB.Arch 2026Yaoran ShiB.Arch 2026Jerry XuB.Arch 2026Henry YoungrenB.Arch 2026Patrick ZhengB.Arch 2026Jesse ZhangB.Arch 2027Spencer BordenickM.Arch 2024Parth DanaitM.Arch 2024Charlie (Yu Cheng) HsuM.Arch 2024Keqing (Clara) JiaoM.Arch 2024Trevor OrgillM.Arch 2024Hrushikesh ShahM.Arch 2024Shail ShethM.Arch 2024Shayla ThomasM.Arch 2024Saloni AgarwalMUD 2023Keyi ChaiMUD 2023Ritika NarangMUD 2023Yi ZhouMUD 2023Aniket SurveMUD 2024Joshua RainMSCD 2023Phoebe DeGrootMSCD 2024David TroetschelMSCD 2024Sanaz SaadatifarPhD-AECM 2023Kushagra VarmaPhD-AECM 2023Nihar PathakPhD-AECM 2025Suzy LiPhD-BPD 2023Jiarong XiePhD-BPD 2023Guanzhou JiPhD-BPD 2025Tian LiPhD-BPD 2025Niloofar NikookarPhD-BPD 2025Zhan ShiPhD-BPD 2025Jinmo RheePhD-CD 2024Morgan NewmanPhD in Architecture 2026Carnegie Mellon Architecture, 5000 Forbes Avenue, College of Fine Arts 201, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 | 412.268.2354Statement of Assurance | Legal Info | Contact Us | Careers | Donate Copyright ©  Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture | All Rights Reserved

StudentsWho We Really AreUndergraduate Students Masters & PhD Students





Our students put their heart into the work.Our students have disparate perspectives, backgrounds, and goals; they break any and every mold. Though every School of Architecture student graduates with intensive architecture knowledge, no two graduates leave with the same education. In the twenty-first century, few architecture problems are straightforward. School of Architecture graduates excel in the roles architects have performed for centuries—and in new roles catalyzed by the depth and breadth of their education—to create and execute innovative solutions to a wide range of emerging global challenges.Note: Clicking on the profile images below will take you out of the School of Architecture’s website and into students' self-curated online portfolios, which are entirely under their own jurisdiction. Profiles are provided at each student's discretion, therefore not all current students are listed.

Our students put their heart into the work.Our students have disparate perspectives, backgrounds, and goals; they break any and every mold. Though every School of Architecture student graduates with intensive architecture knowledge, no two graduates leave with the same education. In the twenty-first century, few architecture problems are straightforward. School of Architecture graduates excel in the roles architects have performed for centuries—and in new roles catalyzed by the depth and breadth of their education—to create and execute innovative solutions to a wide range of emerging global challenges.Note: Clicking on the profile images below will take you out of the School of Architecture’s website and into students' self-curated online portfolios, which are entirely under their own jurisdiction. Profiles are provided at each student's discretion, therefore not all current students are listed.

Our students put their heart into the work.Our students have disparate perspectives, backgrounds, and goals; they break any and every mold. Though every School of Architecture student graduates with intensive architecture knowledge, no two graduates leave with the same education. In the twenty-first century, few architecture problems are straightforward. School of Architecture graduates excel in the roles architects have performed for centuries—and in new roles catalyzed by the depth and breadth of their education—to create and execute innovative solutions to a wide range of emerging global challenges.Note: Clicking on the profile images below will take you out of the School of Architecture’s website and into students' self-curated online portfolios, which are entirely under their own jurisdiction. Profiles are provided at each student's discretion, therefore not all current students are listed.
