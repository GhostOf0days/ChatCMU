Mindy’s ongoing Cyberfeminism Index, which gathers three decades of online activism and net art, was commissioned by Rhizome and presented at the New Museum in its online form, and its print form is a recipient of a Graham Foundation Grant. She has lectured internationally at cultural institutions (Barbican Centre, New Museum), academic institutions (Columbia University, Central Saint Martins), and mainstream platforms (Pornhub, SSENSE, Google), among many others, and has been a resident at MacDowell, Sitterwerk Foundation, Pioneer Works, and Internet Archive. Mindy holds an M.Des. from Harvard’s Graduate School of Design and a B.A. in Design Media Arts from the University of California, Los Angeles. She is currently Assistant Professor at Rutgers Mason Gross School of the Arts and Critic at Yale School of Art.

She holds a MFA from Carnegie Mellon University, and has been the recipient of two Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowships in New Genres, a Creative Capital grant in Emerging Fields, a MacDowell Colony Fellowship in Interdisciplinary Arts, and an Artist Opportunity Grant from the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council.

Angela Washko bio:
Angela Washko is an artist, filmmaker, and experimental game developer who creates new forums for discussions about feminism in spaces frequently hostile towards it.

Please join the School of Art and the STUDIO for Creative Inquiry as designer, technologist, and author Mindy Seu presents the Cyberfeminism Index, a comprehensive book recently published by Inventory Press, in Kresge Theatre on September 25th.
Edited by Seu, the book collects over 700 entries of radical techno-critical activism in a variety of media, including excerpts from academic articles and scholarly texts; descriptions of hackerspaces, digital rights activist groups, and bio-hacktivism; and depictions of feminist net art and new media art. Mindy Seu will present a participatory performative lecture about the book and her practice as a designer, technologist, and cyberfeminist activist. Seu’s presentation will be followed by a panel featuring Pittsburgh-based artists included in the Cyberfeminist Index (Hyla Willis of subRosa & Angela Washko).
