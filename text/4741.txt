The waiver process involves documentation of prior coursework and experience and thorough evaluation of material learned. The Chair of the Ph.D. Program will then assign a suitable faculty member to evaluate the request, typically the relevant course instructor or an expert on the topic. The faculty member will then conduct an evaluation which may include oral examination, proctoring of course quizzes or exams including final exams, assigning course exercises, assignments or projects, or any combination of these.  They will assess the extent and quality of knowledge and its sufficiency relative to the course objectives and requirements. In some cases, the faculty may determine that a student has demonstrated significant knowledge of the research area, but not sufficient to waive the course requirement entirely. In such cases, the faculty may grant a conditional waiver, contingent upon additional work, such as successfully acting as teaching assistant in the course or completing some designated project.  If a student disagrees with the outcome of the waiver application, they may petition the Robotics Program Committee to review the case.Waiver applications must be submitted during the first year in the Ph.D. program.Thesis Proposal & Defense ProceduresSCS Rooms Audio-Visual ResourcesABOUTDiversity, Equity and InclusionHiring Faculty PositionsHistory of the Robotics InstituteMaps, Directions & ParkingRI Branding & IdentityDiversity, Equity and InclusionHiring Faculty PositionsHistory of the Robotics InstituteMaps, Directions & ParkingRI Branding & IdentityPEOPLEAllFacultySpecial FacultyPostdocsStaffInstitute StaffProject StaffStudentsPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesVisitorsAdjunct Faculty and AffiliatesAlumniAllFacultySpecial FacultyPostdocsStaffInstitute StaffProject StaffInstitute StaffProject StaffStudentsPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesPhDMSRMSCVMRSDAll RI StudentsNon-RI Student EmployeesVisitorsAdjunct Faculty and AffiliatesAlumniRESEARCHResearchPublicationsCentersLabs & GroupsProjectsRobotsResearchPublicationsCentersLabs & GroupsProjectsRobotsEDUCATIONAcademic ProgramsBachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)CoursesCMU Student ServicesRI Student LifeRI Summer ScholarsAcademic ProgramsBachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)Bachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR)Additional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramAdditional Major in RoboticsMinor in RoboticsAccelerated Graduate ProgramMaster of Science in Robotics (MSR)Master of Science in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD)Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV)Doctoral in Robotics (PhD)CoursesCMU Student ServicesRI Student LifeRI Summer ScholarsNEWSVideosVideosEVENTSAll EventsSeminarsStudent TalksSpecial EventsFaculty EventsStaff EventsRobotics Institute Seminar VideosAll EventsSeminarsStudent TalksSpecial EventsFaculty EventsStaff EventsRobotics Institute Seminar VideosNREC

Research Qualifier - Committee [ Webform ]


To oversee this process, the student forms a Research Qualifier Committee consisting of three faculty members and one Robotics Ph.D. student who has completed his or her second year of study. One faculty committee member must hold a primary appointment in Robotics. The faculty members should include the student's advisor, one faculty member from the student's research area, and one faculty member from outside the area. Typically, the student's advisor will be the chairperson of the committee. The total time required for a student to accomplish the research qualifier is expected to be approximately 50% effort for two years. Any student who does not complete the entire Research Qualifier by the end of the third year of study will no longer be in good standing in the Program, subject to the judgment of the faculty.

Developing independent research skills is critical for the success of each of our students. The research qualifier is intended to examine
the student's ability to formulate, investigate, and evaluate research questions independently. Students are expected to meet
periodically with each member of their Research Qualifier Committee to discuss their research progress, plans, expectations, and
intentions. Throughout this process the members of the qualifier committee will evaluate the student's research accomplishments,
including awareness of previous work in the area, depth of insight into the problem area, adequacy of the approaches taken, as well as
the substance and interpretation of results obtained.

Research Qualifier - Committee [ Webform ]


To oversee this process, the student forms a Research Qualifier Committee consisting of three faculty members and one Robotics Ph.D. student who has completed his or her second year of study. One faculty committee member must hold a primary appointment in Robotics. The faculty members should include the student's advisor, one faculty member from the student's research area, and one faculty member from outside the area. Typically, the student's advisor will be the chairperson of the committee. The total time required for a student to accomplish the research qualifier is expected to be approximately 50% effort for two years. Any student who does not complete the entire Research Qualifier by the end of the third year of study will no longer be in good standing in the Program, subject to the judgment of the faculty.

Research Qualifier - Research Skills [ Webform | PDF ]


Developing independent research skills is critical for the success of each of our students. The research qualifier is intended to examine
the student's ability to formulate, investigate, and evaluate research questions independently. Students are expected to meet
periodically with each member of their Research Qualifier Committee to discuss their research progress, plans, expectations, and
intentions. Throughout this process the members of the qualifier committee will evaluate the student's research accomplishments,
including awareness of previous work in the area, depth of insight into the problem area, adequacy of the approaches taken, as well as
the substance and interpretation of results obtained.

Research Qualifier - Teaching Assistantship [ Webform ]

The experience of teaching in a classroom environment. This includes demonstration of as many as possible of the following: lecturing, recitation instruction, homework and exam design, grading, office hours, curriculum design. Each student must serve as a teaching assistant (TA) in two courses relevant to the Robotics Program. Allowable courses will be defined by the Chair of the Program. Students may arrange to serve as TA by contacting the Program Coordinator at the beginning of the semester before the semester in which the student will act as a TA. The student is not required to spend more than twenty hours, but is not prohibited from doing so. The instructor should provide feedback to the student concerning the quality of the student's teaching. The instructor should report to the Program Coordinator his or her evaluation of whether the student has carried out the TA activities successfully.

Specialized Qualifier - [ Webform ]

The Specialized Course Qualifier is a sequence of courses chosen by the student to enhance the Core Course subject matter by adding greater depth a particular area. These specialization courses must total at least 48 units of graduate coursework.  The Specialized Course Qualifier must be defined by the student in conjunction with their Ph.D. Advisor and then approved by the Ph.D. Program Chair.  Students are strongly encouraged to seek approval before completing courses. Any course completed prior to approval is at risk and may not be deemed eligible for their qualifier. ​

SPECIALIZED QUALIFIER GUIDELINES:
Graduate level (600 - 800-level) courses only

No more than 12 units of non-doctoral (600-level) graduate courses
No more than 12 units of project-only courses
No more than 12 units of independent study (Independent study courses must include syllabus, schedule, assignments, and evaluation criteria. Syllabus submitted with the SQ form.)
Core courses can be used in the Specialized Qualifier sequence, but only in addition to 48-units of Core Qualifier courses
Teaching Assistantships cannot be included as Specialized Qualifier courses

LISTING OF CORE COURSES:

Perception: 16-720 Computer Vision, 16-820 Advanced Computer Vision, 16-722 Sensing and Sensors, 16-822 Geometry-based Methods in Vision, 16-823 Physics-based Methods in Vision
Cognition: 15-780 Graduate Artificial Intelligence, 10-701 Machine Learning, 10-715 Advanced Machine Learning, and 16-831 Introduction to Robot Learning

                        Course Waiver                        




If a student possesses all of the knowledge conferred and evaluated in a particular course, they may apply for a waiver to be released from the requirement of enrolling and completing the course. The waiver process involves documentation of prior coursework and experience and thorough evaluation of material learned. 
The Chair of the Ph.D. Program will then assign a suitable faculty member to evaluate the request, typically the relevant course instructor or an expert on the topic. The faculty member will then conduct an evaluation which may include oral examination, proctoring of course quizzes or exams including final exams, assigning course exercises, assignments or projects, or any combination of these.  They will assess the extent and quality of knowledge and its sufficiency relative to the course objectives and requirements. 
In some cases, the faculty may determine that a student has demonstrated significant knowledge of the research area, but not sufficient to waive the course requirement entirely. In such cases, the faculty may grant a conditional waiver, contingent upon additional work, such as successfully acting as teaching assistant in the course or completing some designated project.  If a student disagrees with the outcome of the waiver application, they may petition the Robotics Program Committee to review the case.
Waiver applications must be submitted during the first year in the Ph.D. program.

If a student disagrees with the outcome of the waiver application, they may petition the Robotics Program Committee to review the case.
Waiver applications must be submitted during the first year in the Ph.D. program.

Research Qualifier - Committee [ Webform ]


To oversee this process, the student forms a Research Qualifier Committee consisting of three faculty members and one Robotics Ph.D. student who has completed his or her second year of study. One faculty committee member must hold a primary appointment in Robotics. The faculty members should include the student's advisor, one faculty member from the student's research area, and one faculty member from outside the area. Typically, the student's advisor will be the chairperson of the committee. The total time required for a student to accomplish the research qualifier is expected to be approximately 50% effort for two years. Any student who does not complete the entire Research Qualifier by the end of the third year of study will no longer be in good standing in the Program, subject to the judgment of the faculty.

Developing independent research skills is critical for the success of each of our students. The research qualifier is intended to examine
the student's ability to formulate, investigate, and evaluate research questions independently. Students are expected to meet
periodically with each member of their Research Qualifier Committee to discuss their research progress, plans, expectations, and
intentions. Throughout this process the members of the qualifier committee will evaluate the student's research accomplishments,
including awareness of previous work in the area, depth of insight into the problem area, adequacy of the approaches taken, as well as
the substance and interpretation of results obtained.

                        Course Waiver                        




If a student possesses all of the knowledge conferred and evaluated in a particular course, they may apply for a waiver to be released from the requirement of enrolling and completing the course. The waiver process involves documentation of prior coursework and experience and thorough evaluation of material learned. 
The Chair of the Ph.D. Program will then assign a suitable faculty member to evaluate the request, typically the relevant course instructor or an expert on the topic. The faculty member will then conduct an evaluation which may include oral examination, proctoring of course quizzes or exams including final exams, assigning course exercises, assignments or projects, or any combination of these.  They will assess the extent and quality of knowledge and its sufficiency relative to the course objectives and requirements. 
In some cases, the faculty may determine that a student has demonstrated significant knowledge of the research area, but not sufficient to waive the course requirement entirely. In such cases, the faculty may grant a conditional waiver, contingent upon additional work, such as successfully acting as teaching assistant in the course or completing some designated project.

                        Course Waiver                        




If a student possesses all of the knowledge conferred and evaluated in a particular course, they may apply for a waiver to be released from the requirement of enrolling and completing the course. The waiver process involves documentation of prior coursework and experience and thorough evaluation of material learned. 
The Chair of the Ph.D. Program will then assign a suitable faculty member to evaluate the request, typically the relevant course instructor or an expert on the topic. The faculty member will then conduct an evaluation which may include oral examination, proctoring of course quizzes or exams including final exams, assigning course exercises, assignments or projects, or any combination of these.  They will assess the extent and quality of knowledge and its sufficiency relative to the course objectives and requirements. 
In some cases, the faculty may determine that a student has demonstrated significant knowledge of the research area, but not sufficient to waive the course requirement entirely. In such cases, the faculty may grant a conditional waiver, contingent upon additional work, such as successfully acting as teaching assistant in the course or completing some designated project.  If a student disagrees with the outcome of the waiver application, they may petition the Robotics Program Committee to review the case.
Waiver applications must be submitted during the first year in the Ph.D. program.
