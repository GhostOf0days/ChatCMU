"Not only did I get a sense of how I can write more effectively, but also gained a better understanding of how to optimize my thinking process for different writing tasks."
— Graduate student in Heinz College







"This was one of the best hours spent of my academic career. I have always been insecure about my writing skills, but while working with my tutor, I got very precise and effective feedback. My consultant had already looked at the document I uploaded, had very specific queries as we started the session, and then addressed them with very specific answers."
— Visiting Scholar, Computer Science







"I didn't expect to get much done because I didn't have a draft, but we made a lot of progress with just the outline! I have a better idea of what my paper will be now."
— Undergraduate student in Psychology and Linguistics







"This is the type of personal attention you need that can sometimes be forgotten in college."
— Undergraduate student, School of Design

"Not only did I get a sense of how I can write more effectively, but also gained a better understanding of how to optimize my thinking process for different writing tasks."
— Graduate student in Heinz College







"This was one of the best hours spent of my academic career. I have always been insecure about my writing skills, but while working with my tutor, I got very precise and effective feedback. My consultant had already looked at the document I uploaded, had very specific queries as we started the session, and then addressed them with very specific answers."
— Visiting Scholar, Computer Science







"I didn't expect to get much done because I didn't have a draft, but we made a lot of progress with just the outline! I have a better idea of what my paper will be now."
— Undergraduate student in Psychology and Linguistics







"This is the type of personal attention you need that can sometimes be forgotten in college."
— Undergraduate student, School of Design
