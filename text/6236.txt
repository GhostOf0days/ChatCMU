Posted on September 23, 2022Professor Katherine Hubbard‘s work is included in “Ecstatic Land,” an exhibition and screening series that brings together a multigenerational group of artists whose works explore the intersecting vitalities of the land and self. The exhibition is on view October 26 through May 7.The word ecstatic comes from the Greek ἔκστασις [ekstasis], meaning “to stand outside oneself.” In nature, and particularly in the vast expanses of the desert, one can experience physical contact with the earth while being emotionally and psychologically transported elsewhere. This affect, present in the artworks in Ecstatic Land, connects material and exterior sites with interior, emotional, psychic states. Land is celebrated as a living force, and the exhibiting artists’ photographs, paintings, films, videos, sculptures, and sounds harmonize the pleasures of seeing what’s around us with those of inward reflection.Western art-historical traditions of the landscape genre largely focus on the framing of particular views of nature, often as demonstrations of power and control. And while the artists in Ecstatic Land each reference the natural world, they are not creating landscapes per se. Rather than reproducing or framing views, their works reveal new subjectivities and methods for perceiving shared environments. These artworks transport us beyond sight, reconnecting us to the world through embodied experiences. Challenging and expanding single-point perspectives, these artists offer personal views that would otherwise be invisible, intangible or overlooked. Their approaches run counter to the privatization, misuse, and over-consumption of common spaces and resources. Ecstatic Land proposes ways to live dynamically, critically, queerly, and consciously on and with the land.Exhibition websiteCopyright © 2023 School of Art | Carnegie Mellon University.

Professor Katherine Hubbard‘s work is included in “Ecstatic Land,” an exhibition and screening series that brings together a multigenerational group of artists whose works explore the intersecting vitalities of the land and self. The exhibition is on view October 26 through May 7.
