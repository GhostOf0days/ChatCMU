Application Steps

The Common Application opens August 1. The application fee is $75.

Carnegie Mellon accepts fee waivers from students who meet one of the indicators of economic need as outlined on the Common Application. Contact admission@andrew.cmu.edu if you have questions.


The School of Art Slideroom Portfolio & Writing Prompts opens September 1. See Portfolio Guidelines.

There is an application fee of $20. If you receive a Common App fee waiver, you may also qualify for a Slideroom fee waiver. Reach out to slugtu@cmu.edu to request this before submitting your portfolio.


Domestic students only: Fill out your FAFSA. Form opens early 2024. See deadlines for your home state here.

The FAFSA is not required to be admitted to CMU, but it is required to be considered for Scholarships, grants, and other institutional funding.
Carnegie Mellon’s federal code is 003242.
Use last year’s tax information to complete the FAFSA. You will need to fill out the FAFSA every year, no matter what University you choose to attend.
Some applicants may be randomly selected for IRS verification. This is annoying but normal. Make sure to check your status after completing the form in case this happens, which can cause your FAFSA to be considered incomplete.


Domestic students interested in being considered for potential institutional funding and scholarship: Fill out the CSS Profile.

The CSS Profile is not required to be admitted to CMU, but it is required to be considered for Scholarships, grants, and other institutional funding.
Carnegie Mellon’s CSS College Code is 2074.
Carnegie Mellon receives your data electronically from CSS, so there is no need to send copies.
In the case of divorced or separated parents, the noncustodial parent will complete an additional CSS Profile application using different College Board accounts/log-in credentials. For more information, see Info for Divorced and Separated Parents.


Within one to five business days of submitting your Common Application, the Office of Admission will send you an email notifying you that we’ve received your application and how to set up a Where Am I in the Process? Portal. If there are any issues with your application, missing documents etc. this will be requested through the portal.
International students do not qualify for fee waivers, Scholarships, or institutional funding at the point of Admissions.
