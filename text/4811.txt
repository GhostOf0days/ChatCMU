In this webcast, Charles Wallen, Carol Woody, and Michael Bandor discuss how organizations can connect Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to acquisition and development.This paper is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Framework that is a starting point for expanding the use of SBOMs for managing software and systems risk.This report provides an overview of the Acquisition Security Framework (ASF), a description of the practices developed thus far, and a plan for completing the ASF body of work.The Acquisition Security Framework (ASF) contains practices that support programs acquiring/building a secure, resilient software-reliant system to manage risks.This paper describes the cybersecurity challenges that Department of Defense programs faced when adopting DevSecOps practices and how they addressed them.Panel members discussed OSA from several perspectives, including technical engineering, policy, contracting, and science and technology research.This presentation shows a program dashboard representation used in some Air Force programs to aggregate the data being reported and includes methods that provide some insight into schedule risk.This paper examines using Agile techniques in the software sustainment arena—specifically Air Force programs. The intended audience is the staff of DoD programs and related personnel who intend to use Agile methods during software sustainment.This technical note looks at the evaluation and negotiation of technical proposals that reflect iterative development approaches that in turn leverage Agile methods. Michael Bandor discusses technology readiness assessments, which the DoD defines as a formal, systematic, metrics-based process and accompanying report that assess the maturity of critical hardware and software technologies to be used in systems.In this 2010 presentation, Michael Bandor and Suzanne Garcia-Miller focus on software issues and shortfalls observed during the DoD Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) processes.This presentation on process and procedure definition was delivered by Mike Bandor at the SEPG 2007, held from March 26-29, 2007.This 2006 report describes methods for selecting candidate commercial off-the-shelf packages for further evaluation, possible methods for evaluation, and other factors besides requirements to be considered.Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute 4500 Fifth Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2612 412-268-5800©2023 Carnegie Mellon University✕AboutOur WorkPublicationsNews and EventsEducation and OutreachCareersAbout LeadershipDivisionsWork with UsCollaboration with CMUHistory of Innovation at the SEI Our Work AgileArtificial Intelligence EngineeringCloud ComputingCyber Workforce DevelopmentCybersecurity Center DevelopmentCybersecurity EngineeringDevSecOpsAll TopicsAll Projects Publications Annual ReviewsBlogDigital LibraryPodcast SeriesSoftware and ToolsTechnical PapersVulnerability Notes DatabaseWebinar Series News and Events NewsEventsSEI Bulletin Education and Outreach CoursesCredentialsCurriculaLicense SEI Materials Careers Job OpeningsDiversity, Equity, and InclusionInternship Opportunities
