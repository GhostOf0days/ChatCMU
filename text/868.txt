The terms typically come from a potential lead investor that has participated in financing rounds with dozens, if not hundreds, of emerging companies. Understanding your cap structure and what terms to push back on are important factors in determining what structural and economic control the original common stockholders will retain in the company post-financing. The purpose of this discussion is to walk through the Series Seed / Series A financing process, as well as the terms that are routinely negotiated in these early-stage financings. Through participating in this session, we hope to provide founders (and investors) with a better understanding of what a ‘clean,’ neutral term sheet should look like and what is required to bring such a financing round to close. Appreciating what’s ‘market’ will help parties avoid wasting time and capital on unnecessary points, while honing in on the terms that are important and relevant to the company’s future success.Thursday, November 9, 2023 12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m. EST In Person: Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship, 3rd Level, Tepper Quad/Virtual Option Presenter: John Funge, DataTribeRegisterPrivacy and cybersecurity are no longer back-office tasks sequestered away from the core of a business.

They are both a threat and opportunity. This seminar will provide an overview of key privacy and cybersecurity regulations, trends and practices that every startup needs to know.

One of the most common complaints of corporate entrepreneurs is being blindsided by questions from outside their areas of expertise. Even well-prepared corporate entrepreneurs have higher-stakes conversations than traditional startup CEOs with stakeholders coming from narrower perspectives.
Before pitching the idea, think about it from the perspective of the functional areas of leadership in the C-Suite. Through what lenses will the most powerful decision-makers in the company view new ideas?
Join us for a lively discussion about better ways to prepare for pitching innovation to the C-Suite, the much higher communications burden placed on intrapreneurs in the early days of innovation and how to better leverage tools such as the Pitching Innovation to the C-Suite Canvas.

You Have a Term Sheet from a Potential Investor on the Table. Now What?
Tuesday, November 7, 202312:30 – 1:30 p.m. ESTSwartz Center for Entrepreneurship, 3rd Level, Tepper Quad/Virtual OptionPresenter: Matthew Weinbaum & David Kalson, Dentons
Register
Negotiating your first term sheet for a convertible preferred stock equity financing can seem daunting. The terms typically come from a potential lead investor that has participated in financing rounds with dozens, if not hundreds, of emerging companies. Understanding your cap structure and what terms to push back on are important factors in determining what structural and economic control the original common stockholders will retain in the company post-financing. The purpose of this discussion is to walk through the Series Seed / Series A financing process, as well as the terms that are routinely negotiated in these early-stage financings. Through participating in this session, we hope to provide founders (and investors) with a better understanding of what a ‘clean,’ neutral term sheet should look like and what is required to bring such a financing round to close. Appreciating what’s ‘market’ will help parties avoid wasting time and capital on unnecessary points, while honing in on the terms that are important and relevant to the company’s future success.

To Trust or Not to Trust: What Every Startup Needs to Know about Privacy and Cybersecurity

Privacy and cybersecurity are no longer back-office tasks sequestered away from the core of a business. With a steady drum beat of high-profile security breaches and cases of customer data mismanagement, privacy and security are increasingly becoming board-level topics for companies large and small. They are both a threat and opportunity. This seminar will provide an overview of key privacy and cybersecurity regulations, trends and practices that every startup needs to know.

One of the most common complaints of corporate entrepreneurs is being blindsided by questions from outside their areas of expertise. Even well-prepared corporate entrepreneurs have higher-stakes conversations than traditional startup CEOs with stakeholders coming from narrower perspectives.
Before pitching the idea, think about it from the perspective of the functional areas of leadership in the C-Suite. Through what lenses will the most powerful decision-makers in the company view new ideas?
Join us for a lively discussion about better ways to prepare for pitching innovation to the C-Suite, the much higher communications burden placed on intrapreneurs in the early days of innovation and how to better leverage tools such as the Pitching Innovation to the C-Suite Canvas.

You Have a Term Sheet from a Potential Investor on the Table. Now What?
Tuesday, November 7, 202312:30 – 1:30 p.m. ESTSwartz Center for Entrepreneurship, 3rd Level, Tepper Quad/Virtual OptionPresenter: Matthew Weinbaum & David Kalson, Dentons
Register
Negotiating your first term sheet for a convertible preferred stock equity financing can seem daunting. The terms typically come from a potential lead investor that has participated in financing rounds with dozens, if not hundreds, of emerging companies. Understanding your cap structure and what terms to push back on are important factors in determining what structural and economic control the original common stockholders will retain in the company post-financing. The purpose of this discussion is to walk through the Series Seed / Series A financing process, as well as the terms that are routinely negotiated in these early-stage financings. Through participating in this session, we hope to provide founders (and investors) with a better understanding of what a ‘clean,’ neutral term sheet should look like and what is required to bring such a financing round to close. Appreciating what’s ‘market’ will help parties avoid wasting time and capital on unnecessary points, while honing in on the terms that are important and relevant to the company’s future success.

To Trust or Not to Trust: What Every Startup Needs to Know about Privacy and Cybersecurity

Register
Privacy and cybersecurity are no longer back-office tasks sequestered away from the core of a business. With a steady drum beat of high-profile security breaches and cases of customer data mismanagement, privacy and security are increasingly becoming board-level topics for companies large and small. They are both a threat and opportunity. This seminar will provide an overview of key privacy and cybersecurity regulations, trends and practices that every startup needs to know.

Negotiating your first term sheet for a convertible preferred stock equity financing can seem daunting. The terms typically come from a potential lead investor that has participated in financing rounds with dozens, if not hundreds, of emerging companies. Understanding your cap structure and what terms to push back on are important factors in determining what structural and economic control the original common stockholders will retain in the company post-financing. The purpose of this discussion is to walk through the Series Seed / Series A financing process, as well as the terms that are routinely negotiated in these early-stage financings. Through participating in this session, we hope to provide founders (and investors) with a better understanding of what a ‘clean,’ neutral term sheet should look like and what is required to bring such a financing round to close. Appreciating what’s ‘market’ will help parties avoid wasting time and capital on unnecessary points, while honing in on the terms that are important and relevant to the company’s future success.

One of the most common complaints of corporate entrepreneurs is being blindsided by questions from outside their areas of expertise. Even well-prepared corporate entrepreneurs have higher-stakes conversations than traditional startup CEOs with stakeholders coming from narrower perspectives.
Before pitching the idea, think about it from the perspective of the functional areas of leadership in the C-Suite. Through what lenses will the most powerful decision-makers in the company view new ideas?
Join us for a lively discussion about better ways to prepare for pitching innovation to the C-Suite, the much higher communications burden placed on intrapreneurs in the early days of innovation and how to better leverage tools such as the Pitching Innovation to the C-Suite Canvas.

You Have a Term Sheet from a Potential Investor on the Table. Now What?
Tuesday, November 7, 202312:30 – 1:30 p.m. ESTSwartz Center for Entrepreneurship, 3rd Level, Tepper Quad/Virtual OptionPresenter: Matthew Weinbaum & David Kalson, Dentons
Register
Negotiating your first term sheet for a convertible preferred stock equity financing can seem daunting. The terms typically come from a potential lead investor that has participated in financing rounds with dozens, if not hundreds, of emerging companies. Understanding your cap structure and what terms to push back on are important factors in determining what structural and economic control the original common stockholders will retain in the company post-financing. The purpose of this discussion is to walk through the Series Seed / Series A financing process, as well as the terms that are routinely negotiated in these early-stage financings. Through participating in this session, we hope to provide founders (and investors) with a better understanding of what a ‘clean,’ neutral term sheet should look like and what is required to bring such a financing round to close. Appreciating what’s ‘market’ will help parties avoid wasting time and capital on unnecessary points, while honing in on the terms that are important and relevant to the company’s future success.

With a steady drum beat of high-profile security breaches and cases of customer data mismanagement, privacy and security are increasingly becoming board-level topics for companies large and small. They are both a threat and opportunity. This seminar will provide an overview of key privacy and cybersecurity regulations, trends and practices that every startup needs to know.
