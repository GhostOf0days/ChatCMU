Update from Chair David Coulter
Equipping Tomorrow's Leaders
Carnegie Mellon University is educating, preparing and inspiring the leaders of the future to tackle tomorrow’s challenges. That’s a role we do not take lightly.  
The issues facing our world are great, and so are the opportunities. When we make accessing a CMU education possible for every talented student regardless of their circumstance, we equip them with the knowledge, skills and flexibility to seize the possibilities, innovate solutions and move us all forward to a brighter future. But before these students can stride confidently into that future, we have to open the door for them.
