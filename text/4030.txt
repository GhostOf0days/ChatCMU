 Internships not only lead to careers–they help students find their passions.
The Pittsburgh Summer Internship Program (PSIP) provides financial support and resources to connect Dietrich College undergraduate students to their first internship experience at a non-profit, start-up or small business in the Pittsburgh area.
The goals of this program are to:

offer students the chance to gain their first meaningful internship experience
provide organizations with capable interns to support their work contribute to the strength and vibrancy of the Pittsburgh community

 Internships not only lead to careers–they help students find their passions.
The Pittsburgh Summer Internship Program (PSIP) provides financial support and resources to connect Dietrich College undergraduate students to their first internship experience at a non-profit, start-up or small business in the Pittsburgh area.
The goals of this program are to:

offer students the chance to gain their first meaningful internship experience
provide organizations with capable interns to support their work contribute to the strength and vibrancy of the Pittsburgh community

 Internships not only lead to careers–they help students find their passions.
The Pittsburgh Summer Internship Program (PSIP) provides financial support and resources to connect Dietrich College undergraduate students to their first internship experience at a non-profit, start-up or small business in the Pittsburgh area.
The goals of this program are to:

offer students the chance to gain their first meaningful internship experience
provide organizations with capable interns to support their work contribute to the strength and vibrancy of the Pittsburgh community
