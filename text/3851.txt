January 19, 2024January 19, 2024June 1, 2024   - NEHA DWIVEDI (MIIPS '22)Not everyone has the luxury of visiting campus, meeting face-to-face with faculty, and sitting in on a class. So we’ve created opportunities to bring the iii experience to you:By making these opportunities more accessible for all, prospective students regardless of ability, socioeconomic status, citizenship status, location, etc. are better informed about iii programs and application processes and thus better equipped at preparing a strong application package for the right program for them.A holistic review process means candidates are not automatically admitted or denied based on GPA or test scores. Our admission review process takes into consideration all aspects: GPA, letters of recommendation, video essay response, work experience, goals and interests aligned with our department, and relevant test scores and portfolios as supplied.We do not utilize long Statements of Purpose but rather a series of short essays to better understand you, your interest in the iii, and your career goal.Since fall 2021, we have made the decision to be GRE/GMAT optional. For those who have not taken the GRE, the weight of components considered in the review process will be redistributed among all submitted materials. In short - YES the GRE is really optional. In 2022, 43% of admitted iii students provided the GRE and 57% of admitted iii students did not provide the GRE - data which supports that our process of being GRE Optional is not biased in favor of students supplying the GRE.To provide a more accessible English proficiency exam option for international applicants, we now accept not just the TOEFL and IELTS but also the Duolingo English Test. This option allows applicants to take their English proficiency exam online without an appointment.Unofficial transcripts are sufficient for the purpose of rendering an admission decision.

 Innovation Includes Everyone
  
 One of the goals behind the Integrated Innovation Institute is to integrate diverse and varied perspectives to achieve innovation. But we would be remiss not to acknowledge that there are inherent advantages and disadvantages to certain populations created by the systems that are in place. We acknowledge these disparities and aim to make things right with not just words but action.We pride ourselves on having utilized a truly holistic approach since our department’s creation. However there is always room to improve to make our admissions process more equitable and inclusive. Here are the steps we’ve taken to do just that:
 
"Every person brought a very different perspective 
... and I do believe that it is that difference in perspectives, cultures, backgrounds, and professions that really makes our program so unique and so special."

- NEHA DWIVEDI (MIIPS '22)

 


Accessibility to Information
Not everyone has the luxury of visiting campus, meeting face-to-face with faculty, and sitting in on a class. So we’ve created opportunities to bring the iii experience to you:

One-on-one virtual/phone appointments with the Associate Director of Admissions
Zoom meetings with current student Admissions Ambassadors on your schedule
Programmatic informational webinars


Virtual Visits
By making these opportunities more accessible for all, prospective students regardless of ability, socioeconomic status, citizenship status, location, etc. are better informed about iii programs and application processes and thus better equipped at preparing a strong application package for the right program for them.

Virtual admissions specific webinars including an overview of the application process and portfolio Q&A with the program director
Virtual class visit opportunities


Application Process
A holistic review process means candidates are not automatically admitted or denied based on GPA or test scores. Our admission review process takes into consideration all aspects: GPA, letters of recommendation, video essay response, work experience, goals and interests aligned with our department, and relevant test scores and portfolios as supplied.
We do not utilize long Statements of Purpose but rather a series of short essays to better understand you, your interest in the iii, and your career goal.

Academic Testing
Since fall 2021, we have made the decision to be GRE/GMAT optional. For those who have not taken the GRE, the weight of components considered in the review process will be redistributed among all submitted materials. In short - YES the GRE is really optional. In 2022, 43% of admitted iii students provided the GRE and 57% of admitted iii students did not provide the GRE - data which supports that our process of being GRE Optional is not biased in favor of students supplying the GRE.To provide a more accessible English proficiency exam option for international applicants, we now accept not just the TOEFL and IELTS but also the Duolingo English Test. This option allows applicants to take their English proficiency exam online without an appointment.

 The iii Experience: In Their Own Words


 
"I felt that I could lead others, but there is a ceiling without a specific skillset. I enrolled in the part-time Master of Science in Software Management program because I wanted to deepen my management and software engineering skills and to develop my business acumen."
- Max Alt, MSSM '07Distinguished Technologist, Hewlett Packard Enterprise 



 
"What drew me to Carnegie Mellon’s MIIPS program was my interest in thinking holistically about the design process in physical products. The opportunity to pursue this program remotely has opened the door for me to further expand my knowledge and expertise as a technology executive leading Product and UX design teams."
- Teresa Cain, MIIPS Online studentDirector of Product Management, User Experience & Design at TreviPay 



 
"This skillset is a very powerful one. Understanding the creative process and how you can bring that to bear within a team to solve a problem is the heart of what I got out of my MIIPS degree."
- Kavi Pather, MIIPS '20Africa Artifical Intelligence and Advanced Analytics Leader, Ernst & Young

 Innovation Includes Everyone
  
 One of the goals behind the Integrated Innovation Institute is to integrate diverse and varied perspectives to achieve innovation. But we would be remiss not to acknowledge that there are inherent advantages and disadvantages to certain populations created by the systems that are in place. We acknowledge these disparities and aim to make things right with not just words but action.We pride ourselves on having utilized a truly holistic approach since our department’s creation. However there is always room to improve to make our admissions process more equitable and inclusive. Here are the steps we’ve taken to do just that:
 
"Every person brought a very different perspective 
... and I do believe that it is that difference in perspectives, cultures, backgrounds, and professions that really makes our program so unique and so special."

- NEHA DWIVEDI (MIIPS '22)

 


Accessibility to Information
Not everyone has the luxury of visiting campus, meeting face-to-face with faculty, and sitting in on a class. So we’ve created opportunities to bring the iii experience to you:

One-on-one virtual/phone appointments with the Associate Director of Admissions
Zoom meetings with current student Admissions Ambassadors on your schedule
Programmatic informational webinars


Virtual Visits
By making these opportunities more accessible for all, prospective students regardless of ability, socioeconomic status, citizenship status, location, etc. are better informed about iii programs and application processes and thus better equipped at preparing a strong application package for the right program for them.

Virtual admissions specific webinars including an overview of the application process and portfolio Q&A with the program director
Virtual class visit opportunities


Application Process
A holistic review process means candidates are not automatically admitted or denied based on GPA or test scores. Our admission review process takes into consideration all aspects: GPA, letters of recommendation, video essay response, work experience, goals and interests aligned with our department, and relevant test scores and portfolios as supplied.
We do not utilize long Statements of Purpose but rather a series of short essays to better understand you, your interest in the iii, and your career goal.

Academic Testing
Since fall 2021, we have made the decision to be GRE/GMAT optional. For those who have not taken the GRE, the weight of components considered in the review process will be redistributed among all submitted materials. In short - YES the GRE is really optional. In 2022, 43% of admitted iii students provided the GRE and 57% of admitted iii students did not provide the GRE - data which supports that our process of being GRE Optional is not biased in favor of students supplying the GRE.To provide a more accessible English proficiency exam option for international applicants, we now accept not just the TOEFL and IELTS but also the Duolingo English Test. This option allows applicants to take their English proficiency exam online without an appointment.

 The iii Experience: In Their Own Words


 
"I felt that I could lead others, but there is a ceiling without a specific skillset. I enrolled in the part-time Master of Science in Software Management program because I wanted to deepen my management and software engineering skills and to develop my business acumen."
- Max Alt, MSSM '07Distinguished Technologist, Hewlett Packard Enterprise 



 
"What drew me to Carnegie Mellon’s MIIPS program was my interest in thinking holistically about the design process in physical products. The opportunity to pursue this program remotely has opened the door for me to further expand my knowledge and expertise as a technology executive leading Product and UX design teams."
- Teresa Cain, MIIPS Online studentDirector of Product Management, User Experience & Design at TreviPay 



 
"This skillset is a very powerful one. Understanding the creative process and how you can bring that to bear within a team to solve a problem is the heart of what I got out of my MIIPS degree."
- Kavi Pather, MIIPS '20Africa Artifical Intelligence and Advanced Analytics Leader, Ernst & Young

 One of the goals behind the Integrated Innovation Institute is to integrate diverse and varied perspectives to achieve innovation. But we would be remiss not to acknowledge that there are inherent advantages and disadvantages to certain populations created by the systems that are in place. We acknowledge these disparities and aim to make things right with not just words but action.We pride ourselves on having utilized a truly holistic approach since our department’s creation. However there is always room to improve to make our admissions process more equitable and inclusive. Here are the steps we’ve taken to do just that:
 
"Every person brought a very different perspective 
... and I do believe that it is that difference in perspectives, cultures, backgrounds, and professions that really makes our program so unique and so special."
