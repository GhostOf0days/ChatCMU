 Tartan Emergency Support Fund
The Tartan Emergency Support Fund (TESF) is non-qualified scholarship funding that has been established to provide enrolled CMU undergraduate and graduate students with emergency funds for unforeseeable expenses related to immediate, short-term personal basic needs for which repayment is not possible. Approved TESF support does not require repayment; however, students receiving these funds are responsible for any potential tax implications. Prior distribution of TESF non-qualified scholarship funding will be considered should a student apply for future or repeat emergency funding.
