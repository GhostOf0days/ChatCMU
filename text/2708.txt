Minor in RoboticsAlex Krause2023-08-16T12:59:00-04:00

Undergraduate Minor in Robotics

Unlock the world of robotics through the Robotics Minor and Concentration, designed for Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduates to delve into the core principles and practical applications of robotics. This immersive journey blends theoretical exploration with hands-on learning, commencing with a foundational introductory course.
In-depth studies continue with essential courses in control systems and robotic manipulation, offering a comprehensive understanding. The Minor is accessible to current Carnegie Mellon undergraduates from any major outside the School of Computer Science, while the Concentration is exclusively available to School of Computer Science undergraduates. Aspiring participants are encouraged to apply once their primary major is declared.

How to ApplyCurriculum - On or after Fall 2023Curriculum - On or before Summer 2023How to Apply

Admission to the Minor / Concentration Program
Admission to the Undergraduate Minor in Robotics or the Undergraduate Concentration in Robotics Program is limited to current students at Carnegie Mellon with declared Primary Majors. Students interested in signing up for the program should fill out the application form after their Major has been declared and added to SIO.
Students from any college outside of the School of Computer Science, can pursue the Minor in Robotics. The nature of the courses required for the Minor makes it ideal for students already pursuing an undergraduate degree in engineering through the College of Engineering. The Concentration in Robotics is only an option for the undergraduate students studying computer science through the School of Computer Science.

Graduate level Mechanical Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering courses that are relevant to robotics may be used to meet the elective requirement with permission from the Program Director.
QPA Requirement
A 2.5 QPA in the Minor curriculum is required for graduation. Courses that are taken Pass/Fail or audited cannot be counted for the Minor.
Double Counting Restriction
Courses being used to satisfy the requirements for the Robotics Minor may not be counted towards another minor. Students are permitted to double count a maximum of two courses from their Major (excluding General Education requirements) towards the Minor in Robotics. Free electives are not subject to the double counting policy.
Undergraduate Minor in Robotics

Unlock the world of robotics through the Robotics Minor and Concentration, designed for Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduates to delve into the core principles and practical applications of robotics. This immersive journey blends theoretical exploration with hands-on learning, commencing with a foundational introductory course.
In-depth studies continue with essential courses in control systems and robotic manipulation, offering a comprehensive understanding. The Minor is accessible to current Carnegie Mellon undergraduates from any major outside the School of Computer Science, while the Concentration is exclusively available to School of Computer Science undergraduates. Aspiring participants are encouraged to apply once their primary major is declared.

Admission to the Minor / Concentration Program
Admission to the Undergraduate Minor in Robotics or the Undergraduate Concentration in Robotics Program is limited to current students at Carnegie Mellon with declared Primary Majors. Students interested in signing up for the program should fill out the application form after their Major has been declared and added to SIO.
Students from any college outside of the School of Computer Science, can pursue the Minor in Robotics. The nature of the courses required for the Minor makes it ideal for students already pursuing an undergraduate degree in engineering through the College of Engineering. The Concentration in Robotics is only an option for the undergraduate students studying computer science through the School of Computer Science.
