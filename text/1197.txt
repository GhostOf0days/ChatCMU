For the first component of support (up to $15,000), identify specific budget items and dollar amounts requested for each, including brief justifications as needed.  Please note the following:

These funds may be used to cover faculty summer salary and course buy-out. However, such expenses must be clearly justified and consistent with college and/or departmental policies.
Overhead will not be charged. However, benefits do need to be accounted for if using funds to pay for salary.
Funds may be used to support external designers or consultants.  However, the need for external consultants must be clearly justified.  It is expected that the PI will have first consulted with the Eberly Center and other internal resources to identify whether a sufficient resource exists within the CMU community.  If selected for a ProSEED award, any use of external consultants or vendors will also require review and approval from the contracts office before funds will be made available.  This may delay the availability of funds and the initiation of the proposed project.  An approved contract is not required at the time of proposal submission.  However, PI's are strongly encouraged to consult with the ProSEED program prior to submission if an external consultant or designer is being considered.  Please email proseed@andrew.cmu.edu with related inquiries.


For the second component of support (up to 30 days of technical personnel time), indicate which kinds of work from the list below are most relevant to the proposed work, and for each, estimate the number of working days that the project will likely need. This is expected to be a rough estimate of your anticipated needs; details (e.g., in amount, nature and scope of work) will be adjusted before awards are finalized, based on a further discussion of project needs and the match to available personnel.

Objectives
The Simon Initiative’s vision is a data-driven, virtuous cycle of learning science research and innovative educational practice that causes demonstrably better learning outcomes for students from any background or place. Simon Initiative Seed grants are intended to enable CMU faculty to pursue learning research or educational practice projects aimed at improving student learning outcomes at CMU and beyond.
Proposals should strive to do one or both of the following:

Pursue learning research (within or outside of CMU courses) that will lead to stronger subsequent grant proposals for extramural funding, e.g., by conducting preliminary work to address a research question on how students learn in technology-enhanced environments. These proposals seed subsequent research and future grant proposals.
Design and test innovative educational practices (within CMU community) that will lead to enhanced student learning outcomes, e.g., by creating/refining a technology-enhanced course innovation and demonstrating improved student learning, here in Pittsburgh or on CMU's global campus. These proposals seed educational transformation.

Eligibility
Full-time faculty at any of the CMU global campuses are eligible to apply. 
Criteria
Successful proposals must:

Deploy technology-enhanced learning in some form. Novelty of educational technologies per se is not the focus of this program but rather the effective and innovative use of educational technologies to enhance learning outcomes or learning science. Proposed work may involve the integration/application of existing educational technologies OR the creation of new educational technologies. Please describe how educational technology is involved in the proposed project.
Collect and analyze data on student learning outcomes. Please specify what direct measures of student learning will be used to assess the effectiveness of educational interventions, guide ongoing improvements, and/or test hypotheses about learning. Note: the Eberly Center (www.cmu.edu/teaching) offers one-on-one consultations and group programs on these issues, and a targeted workshop will be held in January for faculty members who are contemplating ProSEED/Simon Initiative proposal ideas.
Articulate a sustainability plan. Please explain how the proposed work will likely be maintained and extended beyond the scope of the seed grant. Examples include: implementing a course innovation that is likely to be used in other courses and that inspires other faculty to re-use, or adapt it; disseminating the work inside and outside of CMU in a way that likely leads to further adoption or expansion; or producing a basis of work for writing future, successful grants to external funders.

In addition, proposals should, to the degree possible:

Describe meaningful contributions to learning research or educational practice. Proposals should provide a compelling case that the proposed work will make a difference within the project’s scope and beyond, e.g., by describing likely impact(s) in the target context and then estimating transferability to other contexts; by discussing opportunities to disseminate the work inside and outside of CMU.
Leverage results from previous learning research (need not be the PI’s). Proposals should include an evidence-based rationale for the feasibility and success of the proposed work.

Funding Details
Proposals for ProSEED/Simon Initiative Seed Grants may request support of two forms: (1) up to $15,000 in funds (e.g., for faculty salary support, graduate student support, and other purchases) and (2) up to 30 days of technical personnel time (e.g., for pedagogical/assessment support, production of instructional resources, multimedia design, programming for tool development, and data analysis).

Objectives
The Simon Initiative’s vision is a data-driven, virtuous cycle of learning science research and innovative educational practice that causes demonstrably better learning outcomes for students from any background or place. Simon Initiative Seed grants are intended to enable CMU faculty to pursue learning research or educational practice projects aimed at improving student learning outcomes at CMU and beyond.
Proposals should strive to do one or both of the following:

Pursue learning research (within or outside of CMU courses) that will lead to stronger subsequent grant proposals for extramural funding, e.g., by conducting preliminary work to address a research question on how students learn in technology-enhanced environments. These proposals seed subsequent research and future grant proposals.
Design and test innovative educational practices (within CMU community) that will lead to enhanced student learning outcomes, e.g., by creating/refining a technology-enhanced course innovation and demonstrating improved student learning, here in Pittsburgh or on CMU's global campus. These proposals seed educational transformation.

Eligibility
Full-time faculty at any of the CMU global campuses are eligible to apply. 
Criteria
Successful proposals must:

Deploy technology-enhanced learning in some form. Novelty of educational technologies per se is not the focus of this program but rather the effective and innovative use of educational technologies to enhance learning outcomes or learning science. Proposed work may involve the integration/application of existing educational technologies OR the creation of new educational technologies. Please describe how educational technology is involved in the proposed project.
Collect and analyze data on student learning outcomes. Please specify what direct measures of student learning will be used to assess the effectiveness of educational interventions, guide ongoing improvements, and/or test hypotheses about learning. Note: the Eberly Center (www.cmu.edu/teaching) offers one-on-one consultations and group programs on these issues, and a targeted workshop will be held in January for faculty members who are contemplating ProSEED/Simon Initiative proposal ideas.
Articulate a sustainability plan. Please explain how the proposed work will likely be maintained and extended beyond the scope of the seed grant. Examples include: implementing a course innovation that is likely to be used in other courses and that inspires other faculty to re-use, or adapt it; disseminating the work inside and outside of CMU in a way that likely leads to further adoption or expansion; or producing a basis of work for writing future, successful grants to external funders.

In addition, proposals should, to the degree possible:

Describe meaningful contributions to learning research or educational practice. Proposals should provide a compelling case that the proposed work will make a difference within the project’s scope and beyond, e.g., by describing likely impact(s) in the target context and then estimating transferability to other contexts; by discussing opportunities to disseminate the work inside and outside of CMU.
Leverage results from previous learning research (need not be the PI’s). Proposals should include an evidence-based rationale for the feasibility and success of the proposed work.

Funding Details
Proposals for ProSEED/Simon Initiative Seed Grants may request support of two forms: (1) up to $15,000 in funds (e.g., for faculty salary support, graduate student support, and other purchases) and (2) up to 30 days of technical personnel time (e.g., for pedagogical/assessment support, production of instructional resources, multimedia design, programming for tool development, and data analysis). Further details are described below in the project budget section under Application Process. Projects may be budgeted over 1-2 years. It is expected that 5-8 grants will be awarded. Approximately half of these grants will be targeted for faculty new to TEL or learning research.
Application Process
Proposal Submission Process and Format
Proposals should be prepared as follows:

Cover Page (1 page) with the following information:

Principal (or Co-Principal) Investigators' names, affiliations, and contact information
Title of the project
Abstract (up to 200 words)




Project Narrative (2 pages maximum): Summarize the proposed activities, including the motivation or need for the project, any relevant prior work, likely contributions/impact of the work, and its projected sustainability. Be sure to describe the specific context for the proposed work, identify what measures of student learning will be collected, and explain why/how those measures will be used. (Note: Figures and references do not count toward the page limit.)


Project Budget (2 pages maximum)

For the first component of support (up to $15,000), identify specific budget items and dollar amounts requested for each, including brief justifications as needed.  Please note the following:

These funds may be used to cover faculty summer salary and course buy-out. However, such expenses must be clearly justified and consistent with college and/or departmental policies.
Overhead will not be charged. However, benefits do need to be accounted for if using funds to pay for salary.
Funds may be used to support external designers or consultants.  However, the need for external consultants must be clearly justified.  It is expected that the PI will have first consulted with the Eberly Center and other internal resources to identify whether a sufficient resource exists within the CMU community.  If selected for a ProSEED award, any use of external consultants or vendors will also require review and approval from the contracts office before funds will be made available.  This may delay the availability of funds and the initiation of the proposed project.  An approved contract is not required at the time of proposal submission.  However, PI's are strongly encouraged to consult with the ProSEED program prior to submission if an external consultant or designer is being considered.  Please email proseed@andrew.cmu.edu with related inquiries.


For the second component of support (up to 30 days of technical personnel time), indicate which kinds of work from the list below are most relevant to the proposed work, and for each, estimate the number of working days that the project will likely need. This is expected to be a rough estimate of your anticipated needs; details (e.g., in amount, nature and scope of work) will be adjusted before awards are finalized, based on a further discussion of project needs and the match to available personnel.

List of roles for personnel support:

Instructional/pedagogical design (including re-design based on data)
Production of instructional resources
Programming (for tool development)
Multimedia/graphic design
Assessment design
Study design
Data analysis
