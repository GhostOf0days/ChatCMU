Sponsored by the Provost and administered by the Eberly Center, this program aims to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in CMU courses. Fellows participate in monthly cohort meetings and collaborate regularly with Eberly Center consultants to (re)design a CMU course to:Each project also includes collecting data to study its impact and guide future refinements. Fellows receive a $5,000 fellowship and are selected through a competitive application process. CMU faculty may apply for a Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellowship here.For questions about the fellowship or to request a meeting, email us at eberly-assist@andrew.cmu.edu.The request for proposals for the 2023-2024 Academic Year is hereWe are pleased to announce the 2022-2023 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows. The Fellows represent all seven CMU Schools and Colleges, the Pittsburgh and Doha campuses, and a variety of undergraduate and graduate course formats.

We read artists' writings to situate ourselves among a community of people who walked before us through the challenges of making art. Students respond to these works as well as create their own texts, 'zines or essays to sit alongside or inside their own practice. My project is designed to promote more inclusive discussions among students. I also hope to help them recognize and take pride in their own intersectional identities, develop a respect for difference and an understanding of the complex systems that shape us as artists. The class highlights writings and works of a broad range of artists, including BIPOC, Queer, people with disabilities, people with diverse immigration status, and people from a variety of economic backgrounds. Students meet in discussion sections and as a full class and they have flexibility in the ways they present their work to the class. Corey HarperAssistant ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringHeinz School of Information Systems and Public PolicyCourse: 94-802/12-783: Geographical Information SystemsDEI Goal: Creating an environment that welcomes diverse perspectives, enriching classroom discussion and learning.This course is a software-based course, which teaches students how to use analytical tools to investigate spatial relationships, patterns, and processes of economic, social, environmental, healthcare, crime, and transportation phenomena. My project is designed to teach students about equity and equality concepts in geospatial analysis and to promote a more inclusive learning environment. I am adding a course module to teach students about equality and equity and the different metrics for measuring these parameters across a region. So that students can gain additional practice independently, I am integrating these concepts into the homework questions  Additionally, I am integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into the final group project by teaching best practices for inclusive teamwork. To assess learning gains, I am using a survey to ask students about their knowledge of distributional equity and equality at the beginning and end of semester. DEI Goal: Creating a space where all students feel engaged, heard, and valued to support students to achieve a growth mindset, develop a sense of belonging, and improve retention especially from underrepresented populations.My class is a first year Civil and Environmental Engineering course, required for all CEE students and also taken by other engineering students as an elective. The course introduces the discipline by blending lectures with three hands-on projects including project management, civil engineering and structures, and environmental engineering emphasis. My aim for the students is to embrace a growth mindset, speak freely, and continue with their journey of learning so that they may find their place in engineering as well. I also hope to build and cultivate a positive rapport between myself and the students and a mindset to promote belonging. To accomplish my goals, I promote discussions during class, I use growth mindset terminology blended in lessons and feedback, and I train project teams on communication skills by using CollabU. We are assessing our project through pre and post surveys, looking at students’ mindset, belonging in the discipline, and group work preferences. Ryan SullivanProfessorMechanical Engineering, ChemistryCourse: 24-291, 24-381, 09-291, 09-381: Environmental Systems on a Changing Planet (plus STEM Addendum)DEI Goal: Fostering a strong sense of student belonging in environmental science regardless of what discipline students are coming from.This is an introductory course to the interdisciplinary field of environmental science that explores how complex natural environmental systems function and thus support all life, and how human societies are interfering with environmental systems. My project focuses on effectively teaching the diverse range of student discipline backgrounds present in this course where STEM and non-STEM majors explore environmental science together. A 3-unit STEM Addendum course was created to allow STEM majors to explore the science and engineering topics covered in the main course to more technical and quantitative depth while still having all students learning together in the main course. I use a learn before lecture pedagogy throughout so that students are prepared to discuss questions posed to them that help them assess their understanding of the key concepts. I also ask them to submit their muddiest points from each week so we can address those questions. To promote healthy open dialogue during class we first discuss what the goals of engaging in dialogue versus debate or even discussion are.  We then use dialogue as students respond to opening questions on each unit and questions on the pre-class material they had watched and read, as well as in response to discussion prompts on the Canvas forum. Clicker poll questions are also used to allow the entire class to respond. The focus is on recognizing the knowledge value contributed by multi-disciplinary perspectives to understand complex environmental systems.Students are also regularly asked to identify what important roles different disciplines contribute in addressing the global cases study examples explored. I implemented a survey that evaluates each student's sense of belonging in environmental science at the beginning and end of the semester, and students are routinely asked to reflect on their own experiences and thinking regarding sustainability.Nui VatanasakdakulAssociate Teaching ProfessorInformation SystemsCourse: 67-352 E-business and Design Thinking  DEI Goal: Enriching students’ learning experiences, motivation and engagement, through an exploration of their cultural and regional background.This is an elective course targeting students in the Information Systems major, and Tech Entrepreneurship minor. Students learn about how digital platforms and businesses inter-play to produce innovative e-business models, processes, products and services in various contexts from both strategic and hands-on operational perspectives. In the final project, students will set up their own social commerce business in Qatar. My project is designed to promote more inclusive awareness about diversity and the gender gap in entrepreneurship in social commerce education, particularly in a middle eastern context. I aim to create effective pedagogy in fostering knowledge and understanding on the sensitive gender culture in order to empower female entrepreneurs in the social commerce domain. I assign pre-work to prepare students to discuss gender in entrepreneurship in a global context. Then during our discussion I aim to develop their understanding and anticipation on what might be challenges in gender gap and in social commerce entrepreneurship in Qatar. Then, while implementing their social commerce business, students are asked to apply what they have learned to their business practice, and to observe and reflect on their experiences in the report. I am using the mid semester survey to ask students about their awareness of diversity and gender in social commerce entrepreneurship. At the end of semester, I am using the reflective method for students to analyze their learning experiences in a report. Nynke NiezinkAssistant ProfessorStatistics and Data ScienceCourse: 36-226 Introduction to Statistical Inference DEI Goal: Helping students hear and engage with diverse perspectives and experiences through exposures to statisticians and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, and more intense collaboration between students. My course is a large undergraduate class, primarily taken by sophomores and juniors, from a wide range of backgrounds. This course is the second half of a year-long sequence in probability and mathematical statistics. Using the foundations from their probability class, students in this course learn the basic ideas and methods for analyzing data and making inferences about an unknown population based on a data sample. My project is aimed at improving students' sense of belonging in my class and in Statistics. I encourage student connections by introducing recitation sections to the course where they are encouraged to collaborate. I am also improving the inclusiveness of 36-226 by showing the students that statistics has many faces, both as a field and in terms of those who practice it, through new homework problems that introduce students to statisticians and practitioners in short video interviews and related exercises. I am using a survey to assess students' sense of belonging as well as their social network ties within the course context at the beginning and end of the semester. Lynley DoonanAssistant Teaching ProfessorBiological Sciences Amanda WillardDirector of Undergraduate StudiesBiological SciencesCourse: 03-117 Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences  DEI Goal: Increasing our students’ sense of belonging and normalizing setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist.Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences is a first-year, semester long research-based laboratory course. Students work in teams on a research question to learn laboratory techniques followed by final projects in which they ultimately design a research experiment, implement it, analyze the data, and present the results. Our goal is to increase our students’ sense of belonging and normalize setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist so that when our first year students encounter setbacks and failures they are more resilient and feel empowered to persevere in their journey to becoming a scientist. We want to highlight that the path to becoming a scientist is often nonlinear, everyone experiences setbacks and failures, and overcoming them is how you succeed. We ask students to reflect on what setbacks they have faced in the lab and how their laboratory technique has improved as a result; we further highlight this during sharing activities in which upper-class students in other laboratory courses share setbacks they have experienced and discuss how they overcame them. We also invite departmental faculty guest speakers to describe their journey to becoming a scientist and setbacks they encountered in addition to showcasing the research that they do. We are using a survey to assess students’ relationship to failure, whether they see themselves as a scientist, and how they describe the characteristics of a scientist. Abbe DepretisAssistant Teaching Professor Course: 45-893 Communicating DEI in the Workplace  DEI Goal: Teaching DEI practices to apply in the workplace and in their own work and organizations.Communicating DEI in the Workplace is a mini course designed to introduce the concepts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to our part time MBA students in a meaningful and dedicated way and to develop their communication skills within this critical area of the business world. By using students' own stories and perspectives, the class aims to include their voices and combine their experiences with the narratives of others to show a cohesive picture of DEI in the workplace. We will consider ways to communicate the concepts and applications of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion beginning with the hiring process and moving into the workplace, including teamwork, interpersonal interactions, and innovation, and culminating in a final DEI initiative for their organization. John GasperAssociate Teaching Professor Course: 73-348 Behavioral Economics DEI Goal: Increasing students’ sense of belonging in the classroom and field, and engaging students in discussing issues of diversity and inclusion.This course is an elective and intended to give future managers, consultants, and policy makers an introduction to the insights and applications of behavioral economics. It draws together research from psychology and economics to address topics including heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, and the roles of group processes in decision making. Through this fellowship, my aim is to enhance awareness and understanding of how issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion have limited the data we use to inform our understanding of economic processes. By integrating the conversation of diversity in subject pools into material earlier in the course, it is my hope that students feel more comfortable engaging with discussion related to diversity and inclusion. I am also redesigning several assessments in the course to highlight the role of research subjects from different backgrounds. Often this diversity, or lack thereof, is a crucial yet overlooked aspect in generalizing the results of research. I am scaffolding the development of the students’ final replication project to highlight the diversity of their subjects and the role that this might play in what we “know” in the social sciences. I plan on measuring the change in a sense of belonging and sensitivity to DEI issues via pre- and post-tests. Bryan RoutledgeAssociate Professor Course: 70-106 Business Science  DEI Goal: Building shared community guidelines for discussion, to help students discuss how DEI issues impact and are impacted by business decision making, and how business science tools can apply directly to improving the world.The goal of the course is to introduce undergraduates to the academic study of business. The content of the class is to give students experience with the three core ”lenses” used to study and advance the science and practice of business: the mathematics of optimization, economics, and organization behavior. Typically, these concepts are new to students. My goal is to create a more inclusive classroom that does not rely on “background'' engagement where students are mostly passive. Second, DEI issues are ubiquitous in business, so we are making space to address them in the context of the course material. We are spending time discussing our communities guidelines and norms (linked to the business topic of an organization's culture). Each assignment has a tie to a DEI issue where we discuss the connection to business as well as how business science tools can impact DEI issues both negatively and positively. We are using a survey to ask about students' sense of belonging at the beginning and end of the semester.

 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows
Sponsored by the Provost and administered by the Eberly Center, this program aims to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in CMU courses. Fellows participate in monthly cohort meetings and collaborate regularly with Eberly Center consultants to (re)design a CMU course to:

diversify the representation of voices in their disciplines,
increase the prevalence of inclusive teaching at CMU, 
enhance students’ sense of community and belonging, 
generate and disseminate transferable teaching strategies, and
promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in CMU curricula.

Each project also includes collecting data to study its impact and guide future refinements. Fellows receive a $5,000 fellowship and are selected through a competitive application process. CMU faculty may apply for a Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellowship here.

 2022-2023 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows
We are pleased to announce the 2022-2023 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows. The Fellows represent all seven CMU Schools and Colleges, the Pittsburgh and Doha campuses, and a variety of undergraduate and graduate course formats. (See also previous cohorts of Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows.) 
College of Fine Arts
Kim BeckAssociate ProfessorArtCourse: 60-379: In Their Own Words - Artists Writing
 
DEI Goal: Allowing students to express their different perspectives in ways that mirror their interests and backgrounds.
This class is for everyone who wants to read the ideas and language of artists, such as 'zines, poetry, prose, academic writing, memoir, and the things that defy categorization. We read artists' writings to situate ourselves among a community of people who walked before us through the challenges of making art. Students respond to these works as well as create their own texts, 'zines or essays to sit alongside or inside their own practice. My project is designed to promote more inclusive discussions among students. I also hope to help them recognize and take pride in their own intersectional identities, develop a respect for difference and an understanding of the complex systems that shape us as artists. The class highlights writings and works of a broad range of artists, including BIPOC, Queer, people with disabilities, people with diverse immigration status, and people from a variety of economic backgrounds. Students meet in discussion sections and as a full class and they have flexibility in the ways they present their work to the class. 

College of Engineering
Corey HarperAssistant ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringHeinz School of Information Systems and Public PolicyCourse: 94-802/12-783: Geographical Information Systems
DEI Goal: Creating an environment that welcomes diverse perspectives, enriching classroom discussion and learning.
This course is a software-based course, which teaches students how to use analytical tools to investigate spatial relationships, patterns, and processes of economic, social, environmental, healthcare, crime, and transportation phenomena. My project is designed to teach students about equity and equality concepts in geospatial analysis and to promote a more inclusive learning environment. I am adding a course module to teach students about equality and equity and the different metrics for measuring these parameters across a region. So that students can gain additional practice independently, I am integrating these concepts into the homework questions  Additionally, I am integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into the final group project by teaching best practices for inclusive teamwork. To assess learning gains, I am using a survey to ask students about their knowledge of distributional equity and equality at the beginning and end of semester.
Fethiye OzisAssistant Teaching ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringCourse: 12-100 Exploring CEE: Infrastructure and  Environment in a Changing World
 DEI Goal: Creating a space where all students feel engaged, heard, and valued to support students to achieve a growth mindset, develop a sense of belonging, and improve retention especially from underrepresented populations.
My class is a first year Civil and Environmental Engineering course, required for all CEE students and also taken by other engineering students as an elective. The course introduces the discipline by blending lectures with three hands-on projects including project management, civil engineering and structures, and environmental engineering emphasis. My aim for the students is to embrace a growth mindset, speak freely, and continue with their journey of learning so that they may find their place in engineering as well. I also hope to build and cultivate a positive rapport between myself and the students and a mindset to promote belonging. To accomplish my goals, I promote discussions during class, I use growth mindset terminology blended in lessons and feedback, and I train project teams on communication skills by using CollabU. We are assessing our project through pre and post surveys, looking at students’ mindset, belonging in the discipline, and group work preferences. 

Ryan SullivanProfessorMechanical Engineering, ChemistryCourse: 24-291, 24-381, 09-291, 09-381: Environmental Systems on a Changing Planet (plus STEM Addendum)
DEI Goal: Fostering a strong sense of student belonging in environmental science regardless of what discipline students are coming from.
This is an introductory course to the interdisciplinary field of environmental science that explores how complex natural environmental systems function and thus support all life, and how human societies are interfering with environmental systems. My project focuses on effectively teaching the diverse range of student discipline backgrounds present in this course where STEM and non-STEM majors explore environmental science together. A 3-unit STEM Addendum course was created to allow STEM majors to explore the science and engineering topics covered in the main course to more technical and quantitative depth while still having all students learning together in the main course. I use a learn before lecture pedagogy throughout so that students are prepared to discuss questions posed to them that help them assess their understanding of the key concepts. I also ask them to submit their muddiest points from each week so we can address those questions. To promote healthy open dialogue during class we first discuss what the goals of engaging in dialogue versus debate or even discussion are.  We then use dialogue as students respond to opening questions on each unit and questions on the pre-class material they had watched and read, as well as in response to discussion prompts on the Canvas forum. Clicker poll questions are also used to allow the entire class to respond. The focus is on recognizing the knowledge value contributed by multi-disciplinary perspectives to understand complex environmental systems.Students are also regularly asked to identify what important roles different disciplines contribute in addressing the global cases study examples explored. I implemented a survey that evaluates each student's sense of belonging in environmental science at the beginning and end of the semester, and students are routinely asked to reflect on their own experiences and thinking regarding sustainability.

Carnegie Mellon University - Qatar
Nui VatanasakdakulAssociate Teaching ProfessorInformation SystemsCourse: 67-352 E-business and Design Thinking 
 
DEI Goal: Enriching students’ learning experiences, motivation and engagement, through an exploration of their cultural and regional background.
This is an elective course targeting students in the Information Systems major, and Tech Entrepreneurship minor. Students learn about how digital platforms and businesses inter-play to produce innovative e-business models, processes, products and services in various contexts from both strategic and hands-on operational perspectives. In the final project, students will set up their own social commerce business in Qatar. My project is designed to promote more inclusive awareness about diversity and the gender gap in entrepreneurship in social commerce education, particularly in a middle eastern context. I aim to create effective pedagogy in fostering knowledge and understanding on the sensitive gender culture in order to empower female entrepreneurs in the social commerce domain. I assign pre-work to prepare students to discuss gender in entrepreneurship in a global context. Then during our discussion I aim to develop their understanding and anticipation on what might be challenges in gender gap and in social commerce entrepreneurship in Qatar. Then, while implementing their social commerce business, students are asked to apply what they have learned to their business practice, and to observe and reflect on their experiences in the report. I am using the mid semester survey to ask students about their awareness of diversity and gender in social commerce entrepreneurship. At the end of semester, I am using the reflective method for students to analyze their learning experiences in a report. 

Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences
Nynke NiezinkAssistant ProfessorStatistics and Data ScienceCourse: 36-226 Introduction to Statistical Inference
 
DEI Goal: Helping students hear and engage with diverse perspectives and experiences through exposures to statisticians and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, and more intense collaboration between students. 
My course is a large undergraduate class, primarily taken by sophomores and juniors, from a wide range of backgrounds. This course is the second half of a year-long sequence in probability and mathematical statistics. Using the foundations from their probability class, students in this course learn the basic ideas and methods for analyzing data and making inferences about an unknown population based on a data sample. My project is aimed at improving students' sense of belonging in my class and in Statistics. I encourage student connections by introducing recitation sections to the course where they are encouraged to collaborate. I am also improving the inclusiveness of 36-226 by showing the students that statistics has many faces, both as a field and in terms of those who practice it, through new homework problems that introduce students to statisticians and practitioners in short video interviews and related exercises. I am using a survey to assess students' sense of belonging as well as their social network ties within the course context at the beginning and end of the semester. 

Mellon College of Science
Lynley DoonanAssistant Teaching ProfessorBiological Sciences

 
Amanda WillardDirector of Undergraduate StudiesBiological SciencesCourse: 03-117 Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences 

 DEI Goal: Increasing our students’ sense of belonging and normalizing setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist.
Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences is a first-year, semester long research-based laboratory course. Students work in teams on a research question to learn laboratory techniques followed by final projects in which they ultimately design a research experiment, implement it, analyze the data, and present the results. Our goal is to increase our students’ sense of belonging and normalize setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist so that when our first year students encounter setbacks and failures they are more resilient and feel empowered to persevere in their journey to becoming a scientist. We want to highlight that the path to becoming a scientist is often nonlinear, everyone experiences setbacks and failures, and overcoming them is how you succeed. We ask students to reflect on what setbacks they have faced in the lab and how their laboratory technique has improved as a result; we further highlight this during sharing activities in which upper-class students in other laboratory courses share setbacks they have experienced and discuss how they overcame them. We also invite departmental faculty guest speakers to describe their journey to becoming a scientist and setbacks they encountered in addition to showcasing the research that they do. We are using a survey to assess students’ relationship to failure, whether they see themselves as a scientist, and how they describe the characteristics of a scientist. 

Tepper School of Business 
Abbe DepretisAssistant Teaching Professor Course: 45-893 Communicating DEI in the Workplace 

 
DEI Goal: Teaching DEI practices to apply in the workplace and in their own work and organizations.
Communicating DEI in the Workplace is a mini course designed to introduce the concepts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to our part time MBA students in a meaningful and dedicated way and to develop their communication skills within this critical area of the business world. By using students' own stories and perspectives, the class aims to include their voices and combine their experiences with the narratives of others to show a cohesive picture of DEI in the workplace. We will consider ways to communicate the concepts and applications of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion beginning with the hiring process and moving into the workplace, including teamwork, interpersonal interactions, and innovation, and culminating in a final DEI initiative for their organization. 

John GasperAssociate Teaching Professor Course: 73-348 Behavioral Economics

 DEI Goal: Increasing students’ sense of belonging in the classroom and field, and engaging students in discussing issues of diversity and inclusion.
This course is an elective and intended to give future managers, consultants, and policy makers an introduction to the insights and applications of behavioral economics. It draws together research from psychology and economics to address topics including heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, and the roles of group processes in decision making. Through this fellowship, my aim is to enhance awareness and understanding of how issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion have limited the data we use to inform our understanding of economic processes. By integrating the conversation of diversity in subject pools into material earlier in the course, it is my hope that students feel more comfortable engaging with discussion related to diversity and inclusion. I am also redesigning several assessments in the course to highlight the role of research subjects from different backgrounds. Often this diversity, or lack thereof, is a crucial yet overlooked aspect in generalizing the results of research. I am scaffolding the development of the students’ final replication project to highlight the diversity of their subjects and the role that this might play in what we “know” in the social sciences. I plan on measuring the change in a sense of belonging and sensitivity to DEI issues via pre- and post-tests. 

Bryan RoutledgeAssociate Professor Course: 70-106 Business Science
 
 
DEI Goal: Building shared community guidelines for discussion, to help students discuss how DEI issues impact and are impacted by business decision making, and how business science tools can apply directly to improving the world.
The goal of the course is to introduce undergraduates to the academic study of business. The content of the class is to give students experience with the three core ”lenses” used to study and advance the science and practice of business: the mathematics of optimization, economics, and organization behavior. Typically, these concepts are new to students. My goal is to create a more inclusive classroom that does not rely on “background'' engagement where students are mostly passive. Second, DEI issues are ubiquitous in business, so we are making space to address them in the context of the course material. We are spending time discussing our communities guidelines and norms (linked to the business topic of an organization's culture). Each assignment has a tie to a DEI issue where we discuss the connection to business as well as how business science tools can impact DEI issues both negatively and positively. We are using a survey to ask about students' sense of belonging at the beginning and end of the semester.

Eberly Center
                                      ›              Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows
                            


 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows
Sponsored by the Provost and administered by the Eberly Center, this program aims to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in CMU courses. Fellows participate in monthly cohort meetings and collaborate regularly with Eberly Center consultants to (re)design a CMU course to:

diversify the representation of voices in their disciplines,
increase the prevalence of inclusive teaching at CMU, 
enhance students’ sense of community and belonging, 
generate and disseminate transferable teaching strategies, and
promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in CMU curricula.

Each project also includes collecting data to study its impact and guide future refinements. Fellows receive a $5,000 fellowship and are selected through a competitive application process. CMU faculty may apply for a Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellowship here.

 2022-2023 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows
We are pleased to announce the 2022-2023 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows. The Fellows represent all seven CMU Schools and Colleges, the Pittsburgh and Doha campuses, and a variety of undergraduate and graduate course formats. (See also previous cohorts of Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows.) 
College of Fine Arts
Kim BeckAssociate ProfessorArtCourse: 60-379: In Their Own Words - Artists Writing
 
DEI Goal: Allowing students to express their different perspectives in ways that mirror their interests and backgrounds.
This class is for everyone who wants to read the ideas and language of artists, such as 'zines, poetry, prose, academic writing, memoir, and the things that defy categorization. We read artists' writings to situate ourselves among a community of people who walked before us through the challenges of making art. Students respond to these works as well as create their own texts, 'zines or essays to sit alongside or inside their own practice. My project is designed to promote more inclusive discussions among students. I also hope to help them recognize and take pride in their own intersectional identities, develop a respect for difference and an understanding of the complex systems that shape us as artists. The class highlights writings and works of a broad range of artists, including BIPOC, Queer, people with disabilities, people with diverse immigration status, and people from a variety of economic backgrounds. Students meet in discussion sections and as a full class and they have flexibility in the ways they present their work to the class. 

College of Engineering
Corey HarperAssistant ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringHeinz School of Information Systems and Public PolicyCourse: 94-802/12-783: Geographical Information Systems
DEI Goal: Creating an environment that welcomes diverse perspectives, enriching classroom discussion and learning.
This course is a software-based course, which teaches students how to use analytical tools to investigate spatial relationships, patterns, and processes of economic, social, environmental, healthcare, crime, and transportation phenomena. My project is designed to teach students about equity and equality concepts in geospatial analysis and to promote a more inclusive learning environment. I am adding a course module to teach students about equality and equity and the different metrics for measuring these parameters across a region. So that students can gain additional practice independently, I am integrating these concepts into the homework questions  Additionally, I am integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into the final group project by teaching best practices for inclusive teamwork. To assess learning gains, I am using a survey to ask students about their knowledge of distributional equity and equality at the beginning and end of semester.
Fethiye OzisAssistant Teaching ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringCourse: 12-100 Exploring CEE: Infrastructure and  Environment in a Changing World
 DEI Goal: Creating a space where all students feel engaged, heard, and valued to support students to achieve a growth mindset, develop a sense of belonging, and improve retention especially from underrepresented populations.
My class is a first year Civil and Environmental Engineering course, required for all CEE students and also taken by other engineering students as an elective. The course introduces the discipline by blending lectures with three hands-on projects including project management, civil engineering and structures, and environmental engineering emphasis. My aim for the students is to embrace a growth mindset, speak freely, and continue with their journey of learning so that they may find their place in engineering as well. I also hope to build and cultivate a positive rapport between myself and the students and a mindset to promote belonging. To accomplish my goals, I promote discussions during class, I use growth mindset terminology blended in lessons and feedback, and I train project teams on communication skills by using CollabU. We are assessing our project through pre and post surveys, looking at students’ mindset, belonging in the discipline, and group work preferences. 

Ryan SullivanProfessorMechanical Engineering, ChemistryCourse: 24-291, 24-381, 09-291, 09-381: Environmental Systems on a Changing Planet (plus STEM Addendum)
DEI Goal: Fostering a strong sense of student belonging in environmental science regardless of what discipline students are coming from.
This is an introductory course to the interdisciplinary field of environmental science that explores how complex natural environmental systems function and thus support all life, and how human societies are interfering with environmental systems. My project focuses on effectively teaching the diverse range of student discipline backgrounds present in this course where STEM and non-STEM majors explore environmental science together. A 3-unit STEM Addendum course was created to allow STEM majors to explore the science and engineering topics covered in the main course to more technical and quantitative depth while still having all students learning together in the main course. I use a learn before lecture pedagogy throughout so that students are prepared to discuss questions posed to them that help them assess their understanding of the key concepts. I also ask them to submit their muddiest points from each week so we can address those questions. To promote healthy open dialogue during class we first discuss what the goals of engaging in dialogue versus debate or even discussion are.  We then use dialogue as students respond to opening questions on each unit and questions on the pre-class material they had watched and read, as well as in response to discussion prompts on the Canvas forum. Clicker poll questions are also used to allow the entire class to respond. The focus is on recognizing the knowledge value contributed by multi-disciplinary perspectives to understand complex environmental systems.Students are also regularly asked to identify what important roles different disciplines contribute in addressing the global cases study examples explored. I implemented a survey that evaluates each student's sense of belonging in environmental science at the beginning and end of the semester, and students are routinely asked to reflect on their own experiences and thinking regarding sustainability.

Nui VatanasakdakulAssociate Teaching ProfessorInformation SystemsCourse: 67-352 E-business and Design Thinking 
 
DEI Goal: Enriching students’ learning experiences, motivation and engagement, through an exploration of their cultural and regional background.
This is an elective course targeting students in the Information Systems major, and Tech Entrepreneurship minor. Students learn about how digital platforms and businesses inter-play to produce innovative e-business models, processes, products and services in various contexts from both strategic and hands-on operational perspectives. In the final project, students will set up their own social commerce business in Qatar. My project is designed to promote more inclusive awareness about diversity and the gender gap in entrepreneurship in social commerce education, particularly in a middle eastern context. I aim to create effective pedagogy in fostering knowledge and understanding on the sensitive gender culture in order to empower female entrepreneurs in the social commerce domain. I assign pre-work to prepare students to discuss gender in entrepreneurship in a global context. Then during our discussion I aim to develop their understanding and anticipation on what might be challenges in gender gap and in social commerce entrepreneurship in Qatar. Then, while implementing their social commerce business, students are asked to apply what they have learned to their business practice, and to observe and reflect on their experiences in the report. I am using the mid semester survey to ask students about their awareness of diversity and gender in social commerce entrepreneurship. At the end of semester, I am using the reflective method for students to analyze their learning experiences in a report. 

Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences
Nynke NiezinkAssistant ProfessorStatistics and Data ScienceCourse: 36-226 Introduction to Statistical Inference
 
DEI Goal: Helping students hear and engage with diverse perspectives and experiences through exposures to statisticians and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, and more intense collaboration between students. 
My course is a large undergraduate class, primarily taken by sophomores and juniors, from a wide range of backgrounds. This course is the second half of a year-long sequence in probability and mathematical statistics. Using the foundations from their probability class, students in this course learn the basic ideas and methods for analyzing data and making inferences about an unknown population based on a data sample. My project is aimed at improving students' sense of belonging in my class and in Statistics. I encourage student connections by introducing recitation sections to the course where they are encouraged to collaborate. I am also improving the inclusiveness of 36-226 by showing the students that statistics has many faces, both as a field and in terms of those who practice it, through new homework problems that introduce students to statisticians and practitioners in short video interviews and related exercises. I am using a survey to assess students' sense of belonging as well as their social network ties within the course context at the beginning and end of the semester.

Amanda WillardDirector of Undergraduate StudiesBiological SciencesCourse: 03-117 Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences 

 DEI Goal: Increasing our students’ sense of belonging and normalizing setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist.
Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences is a first-year, semester long research-based laboratory course. Students work in teams on a research question to learn laboratory techniques followed by final projects in which they ultimately design a research experiment, implement it, analyze the data, and present the results. Our goal is to increase our students’ sense of belonging and normalize setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist so that when our first year students encounter setbacks and failures they are more resilient and feel empowered to persevere in their journey to becoming a scientist. We want to highlight that the path to becoming a scientist is often nonlinear, everyone experiences setbacks and failures, and overcoming them is how you succeed. We ask students to reflect on what setbacks they have faced in the lab and how their laboratory technique has improved as a result; we further highlight this during sharing activities in which upper-class students in other laboratory courses share setbacks they have experienced and discuss how they overcame them. We also invite departmental faculty guest speakers to describe their journey to becoming a scientist and setbacks they encountered in addition to showcasing the research that they do. We are using a survey to assess students’ relationship to failure, whether they see themselves as a scientist, and how they describe the characteristics of a scientist. 

Tepper School of Business 
Abbe DepretisAssistant Teaching Professor Course: 45-893 Communicating DEI in the Workplace 

 
DEI Goal: Teaching DEI practices to apply in the workplace and in their own work and organizations.
Communicating DEI in the Workplace is a mini course designed to introduce the concepts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to our part time MBA students in a meaningful and dedicated way and to develop their communication skills within this critical area of the business world. By using students' own stories and perspectives, the class aims to include their voices and combine their experiences with the narratives of others to show a cohesive picture of DEI in the workplace. We will consider ways to communicate the concepts and applications of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion beginning with the hiring process and moving into the workplace, including teamwork, interpersonal interactions, and innovation, and culminating in a final DEI initiative for their organization. 

John GasperAssociate Teaching Professor Course: 73-348 Behavioral Economics

 DEI Goal: Increasing students’ sense of belonging in the classroom and field, and engaging students in discussing issues of diversity and inclusion.
This course is an elective and intended to give future managers, consultants, and policy makers an introduction to the insights and applications of behavioral economics. It draws together research from psychology and economics to address topics including heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, and the roles of group processes in decision making. Through this fellowship, my aim is to enhance awareness and understanding of how issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion have limited the data we use to inform our understanding of economic processes. By integrating the conversation of diversity in subject pools into material earlier in the course, it is my hope that students feel more comfortable engaging with discussion related to diversity and inclusion. I am also redesigning several assessments in the course to highlight the role of research subjects from different backgrounds. Often this diversity, or lack thereof, is a crucial yet overlooked aspect in generalizing the results of research. I am scaffolding the development of the students’ final replication project to highlight the diversity of their subjects and the role that this might play in what we “know” in the social sciences. I plan on measuring the change in a sense of belonging and sensitivity to DEI issues via pre- and post-tests. 

Bryan RoutledgeAssociate Professor Course: 70-106 Business Science
 
 
DEI Goal: Building shared community guidelines for discussion, to help students discuss how DEI issues impact and are impacted by business decision making, and how business science tools can apply directly to improving the world.
The goal of the course is to introduce undergraduates to the academic study of business. The content of the class is to give students experience with the three core ”lenses” used to study and advance the science and practice of business: the mathematics of optimization, economics, and organization behavior. Typically, these concepts are new to students. My goal is to create a more inclusive classroom that does not rely on “background'' engagement where students are mostly passive. Second, DEI issues are ubiquitous in business, so we are making space to address them in the context of the course material. We are spending time discussing our communities guidelines and norms (linked to the business topic of an organization's culture). Each assignment has a tie to a DEI issue where we discuss the connection to business as well as how business science tools can impact DEI issues both negatively and positively. We are using a survey to ask about students' sense of belonging at the beginning and end of the semester.

 2022-2023 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows
We are pleased to announce the 2022-2023 Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows. The Fellows represent all seven CMU Schools and Colleges, the Pittsburgh and Doha campuses, and a variety of undergraduate and graduate course formats. (See also previous cohorts of Provost’s Inclusive Teaching Fellows.) 
College of Fine Arts
Kim BeckAssociate ProfessorArtCourse: 60-379: In Their Own Words - Artists Writing
 
DEI Goal: Allowing students to express their different perspectives in ways that mirror their interests and backgrounds.
This class is for everyone who wants to read the ideas and language of artists, such as 'zines, poetry, prose, academic writing, memoir, and the things that defy categorization. We read artists' writings to situate ourselves among a community of people who walked before us through the challenges of making art. Students respond to these works as well as create their own texts, 'zines or essays to sit alongside or inside their own practice. My project is designed to promote more inclusive discussions among students. I also hope to help them recognize and take pride in their own intersectional identities, develop a respect for difference and an understanding of the complex systems that shape us as artists. The class highlights writings and works of a broad range of artists, including BIPOC, Queer, people with disabilities, people with diverse immigration status, and people from a variety of economic backgrounds. Students meet in discussion sections and as a full class and they have flexibility in the ways they present their work to the class. 

College of Engineering
Corey HarperAssistant ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringHeinz School of Information Systems and Public PolicyCourse: 94-802/12-783: Geographical Information Systems
DEI Goal: Creating an environment that welcomes diverse perspectives, enriching classroom discussion and learning.
This course is a software-based course, which teaches students how to use analytical tools to investigate spatial relationships, patterns, and processes of economic, social, environmental, healthcare, crime, and transportation phenomena. My project is designed to teach students about equity and equality concepts in geospatial analysis and to promote a more inclusive learning environment. I am adding a course module to teach students about equality and equity and the different metrics for measuring these parameters across a region. So that students can gain additional practice independently, I am integrating these concepts into the homework questions  Additionally, I am integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into the final group project by teaching best practices for inclusive teamwork. To assess learning gains, I am using a survey to ask students about their knowledge of distributional equity and equality at the beginning and end of semester.
Fethiye OzisAssistant Teaching ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringCourse: 12-100 Exploring CEE: Infrastructure and  Environment in a Changing World
 DEI Goal: Creating a space where all students feel engaged, heard, and valued to support students to achieve a growth mindset, develop a sense of belonging, and improve retention especially from underrepresented populations.
My class is a first year Civil and Environmental Engineering course, required for all CEE students and also taken by other engineering students as an elective. The course introduces the discipline by blending lectures with three hands-on projects including project management, civil engineering and structures, and environmental engineering emphasis. My aim for the students is to embrace a growth mindset, speak freely, and continue with their journey of learning so that they may find their place in engineering as well. I also hope to build and cultivate a positive rapport between myself and the students and a mindset to promote belonging. To accomplish my goals, I promote discussions during class, I use growth mindset terminology blended in lessons and feedback, and I train project teams on communication skills by using CollabU. We are assessing our project through pre and post surveys, looking at students’ mindset, belonging in the discipline, and group work preferences. 

Ryan SullivanProfessorMechanical Engineering, ChemistryCourse: 24-291, 24-381, 09-291, 09-381: Environmental Systems on a Changing Planet (plus STEM Addendum)
DEI Goal: Fostering a strong sense of student belonging in environmental science regardless of what discipline students are coming from.
This is an introductory course to the interdisciplinary field of environmental science that explores how complex natural environmental systems function and thus support all life, and how human societies are interfering with environmental systems. My project focuses on effectively teaching the diverse range of student discipline backgrounds present in this course where STEM and non-STEM majors explore environmental science together. A 3-unit STEM Addendum course was created to allow STEM majors to explore the science and engineering topics covered in the main course to more technical and quantitative depth while still having all students learning together in the main course. I use a learn before lecture pedagogy throughout so that students are prepared to discuss questions posed to them that help them assess their understanding of the key concepts. I also ask them to submit their muddiest points from each week so we can address those questions. To promote healthy open dialogue during class we first discuss what the goals of engaging in dialogue versus debate or even discussion are.  We then use dialogue as students respond to opening questions on each unit and questions on the pre-class material they had watched and read, as well as in response to discussion prompts on the Canvas forum. Clicker poll questions are also used to allow the entire class to respond. The focus is on recognizing the knowledge value contributed by multi-disciplinary perspectives to understand complex environmental systems.Students are also regularly asked to identify what important roles different disciplines contribute in addressing the global cases study examples explored. I implemented a survey that evaluates each student's sense of belonging in environmental science at the beginning and end of the semester, and students are routinely asked to reflect on their own experiences and thinking regarding sustainability.

Carnegie Mellon University - Qatar
Nui VatanasakdakulAssociate Teaching ProfessorInformation SystemsCourse: 67-352 E-business and Design Thinking 
 
DEI Goal: Enriching students’ learning experiences, motivation and engagement, through an exploration of their cultural and regional background.
This is an elective course targeting students in the Information Systems major, and Tech Entrepreneurship minor. Students learn about how digital platforms and businesses inter-play to produce innovative e-business models, processes, products and services in various contexts from both strategic and hands-on operational perspectives. In the final project, students will set up their own social commerce business in Qatar. My project is designed to promote more inclusive awareness about diversity and the gender gap in entrepreneurship in social commerce education, particularly in a middle eastern context. I aim to create effective pedagogy in fostering knowledge and understanding on the sensitive gender culture in order to empower female entrepreneurs in the social commerce domain. I assign pre-work to prepare students to discuss gender in entrepreneurship in a global context. Then during our discussion I aim to develop their understanding and anticipation on what might be challenges in gender gap and in social commerce entrepreneurship in Qatar. Then, while implementing their social commerce business, students are asked to apply what they have learned to their business practice, and to observe and reflect on their experiences in the report. I am using the mid semester survey to ask students about their awareness of diversity and gender in social commerce entrepreneurship. At the end of semester, I am using the reflective method for students to analyze their learning experiences in a report. 

Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences
Nynke NiezinkAssistant ProfessorStatistics and Data ScienceCourse: 36-226 Introduction to Statistical Inference
 
DEI Goal: Helping students hear and engage with diverse perspectives and experiences through exposures to statisticians and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, and more intense collaboration between students. 
My course is a large undergraduate class, primarily taken by sophomores and juniors, from a wide range of backgrounds. This course is the second half of a year-long sequence in probability and mathematical statistics. Using the foundations from their probability class, students in this course learn the basic ideas and methods for analyzing data and making inferences about an unknown population based on a data sample. My project is aimed at improving students' sense of belonging in my class and in Statistics. I encourage student connections by introducing recitation sections to the course where they are encouraged to collaborate. I am also improving the inclusiveness of 36-226 by showing the students that statistics has many faces, both as a field and in terms of those who practice it, through new homework problems that introduce students to statisticians and practitioners in short video interviews and related exercises. I am using a survey to assess students' sense of belonging as well as their social network ties within the course context at the beginning and end of the semester. 

Mellon College of Science
Lynley DoonanAssistant Teaching ProfessorBiological Sciences

 
Amanda WillardDirector of Undergraduate StudiesBiological SciencesCourse: 03-117 Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences 

 DEI Goal: Increasing our students’ sense of belonging and normalizing setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist.
Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences is a first-year, semester long research-based laboratory course. Students work in teams on a research question to learn laboratory techniques followed by final projects in which they ultimately design a research experiment, implement it, analyze the data, and present the results. Our goal is to increase our students’ sense of belonging and normalize setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist so that when our first year students encounter setbacks and failures they are more resilient and feel empowered to persevere in their journey to becoming a scientist. We want to highlight that the path to becoming a scientist is often nonlinear, everyone experiences setbacks and failures, and overcoming them is how you succeed. We ask students to reflect on what setbacks they have faced in the lab and how their laboratory technique has improved as a result; we further highlight this during sharing activities in which upper-class students in other laboratory courses share setbacks they have experienced and discuss how they overcame them. We also invite departmental faculty guest speakers to describe their journey to becoming a scientist and setbacks they encountered in addition to showcasing the research that they do. We are using a survey to assess students’ relationship to failure, whether they see themselves as a scientist, and how they describe the characteristics of a scientist. 

Tepper School of Business 
Abbe DepretisAssistant Teaching Professor Course: 45-893 Communicating DEI in the Workplace 

 
DEI Goal: Teaching DEI practices to apply in the workplace and in their own work and organizations.
Communicating DEI in the Workplace is a mini course designed to introduce the concepts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to our part time MBA students in a meaningful and dedicated way and to develop their communication skills within this critical area of the business world. By using students' own stories and perspectives, the class aims to include their voices and combine their experiences with the narratives of others to show a cohesive picture of DEI in the workplace. We will consider ways to communicate the concepts and applications of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion beginning with the hiring process and moving into the workplace, including teamwork, interpersonal interactions, and innovation, and culminating in a final DEI initiative for their organization. 

John GasperAssociate Teaching Professor Course: 73-348 Behavioral Economics

 DEI Goal: Increasing students’ sense of belonging in the classroom and field, and engaging students in discussing issues of diversity and inclusion.
This course is an elective and intended to give future managers, consultants, and policy makers an introduction to the insights and applications of behavioral economics. It draws together research from psychology and economics to address topics including heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, and the roles of group processes in decision making. Through this fellowship, my aim is to enhance awareness and understanding of how issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion have limited the data we use to inform our understanding of economic processes. By integrating the conversation of diversity in subject pools into material earlier in the course, it is my hope that students feel more comfortable engaging with discussion related to diversity and inclusion. I am also redesigning several assessments in the course to highlight the role of research subjects from different backgrounds. Often this diversity, or lack thereof, is a crucial yet overlooked aspect in generalizing the results of research. I am scaffolding the development of the students’ final replication project to highlight the diversity of their subjects and the role that this might play in what we “know” in the social sciences. I plan on measuring the change in a sense of belonging and sensitivity to DEI issues via pre- and post-tests. 

Bryan RoutledgeAssociate Professor Course: 70-106 Business Science
 
 
DEI Goal: Building shared community guidelines for discussion, to help students discuss how DEI issues impact and are impacted by business decision making, and how business science tools can apply directly to improving the world.
The goal of the course is to introduce undergraduates to the academic study of business. The content of the class is to give students experience with the three core ”lenses” used to study and advance the science and practice of business: the mathematics of optimization, economics, and organization behavior. Typically, these concepts are new to students. My goal is to create a more inclusive classroom that does not rely on “background'' engagement where students are mostly passive. Second, DEI issues are ubiquitous in business, so we are making space to address them in the context of the course material. We are spending time discussing our communities guidelines and norms (linked to the business topic of an organization's culture). Each assignment has a tie to a DEI issue where we discuss the connection to business as well as how business science tools can impact DEI issues both negatively and positively. We are using a survey to ask about students' sense of belonging at the beginning and end of the semester.

Kim BeckAssociate ProfessorArtCourse: 60-379: In Their Own Words - Artists Writing
 
DEI Goal: Allowing students to express their different perspectives in ways that mirror their interests and backgrounds.
This class is for everyone who wants to read the ideas and language of artists, such as 'zines, poetry, prose, academic writing, memoir, and the things that defy categorization. We read artists' writings to situate ourselves among a community of people who walked before us through the challenges of making art. Students respond to these works as well as create their own texts, 'zines or essays to sit alongside or inside their own practice. My project is designed to promote more inclusive discussions among students. I also hope to help them recognize and take pride in their own intersectional identities, develop a respect for difference and an understanding of the complex systems that shape us as artists. The class highlights writings and works of a broad range of artists, including BIPOC, Queer, people with disabilities, people with diverse immigration status, and people from a variety of economic backgrounds. Students meet in discussion sections and as a full class and they have flexibility in the ways they present their work to the class.

Corey HarperAssistant ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringHeinz School of Information Systems and Public PolicyCourse: 94-802/12-783: Geographical Information Systems
DEI Goal: Creating an environment that welcomes diverse perspectives, enriching classroom discussion and learning.
This course is a software-based course, which teaches students how to use analytical tools to investigate spatial relationships, patterns, and processes of economic, social, environmental, healthcare, crime, and transportation phenomena. My project is designed to teach students about equity and equality concepts in geospatial analysis and to promote a more inclusive learning environment. I am adding a course module to teach students about equality and equity and the different metrics for measuring these parameters across a region. So that students can gain additional practice independently, I am integrating these concepts into the homework questions  Additionally, I am integrating diversity, equity, and inclusion into the final group project by teaching best practices for inclusive teamwork. To assess learning gains, I am using a survey to ask students about their knowledge of distributional equity and equality at the beginning and end of semester.
Fethiye OzisAssistant Teaching ProfessorCivil and Environmental EngineeringCourse: 12-100 Exploring CEE: Infrastructure and  Environment in a Changing World
 DEI Goal: Creating a space where all students feel engaged, heard, and valued to support students to achieve a growth mindset, develop a sense of belonging, and improve retention especially from underrepresented populations.
My class is a first year Civil and Environmental Engineering course, required for all CEE students and also taken by other engineering students as an elective. The course introduces the discipline by blending lectures with three hands-on projects including project management, civil engineering and structures, and environmental engineering emphasis. My aim for the students is to embrace a growth mindset, speak freely, and continue with their journey of learning so that they may find their place in engineering as well. I also hope to build and cultivate a positive rapport between myself and the students and a mindset to promote belonging. To accomplish my goals, I promote discussions during class, I use growth mindset terminology blended in lessons and feedback, and I train project teams on communication skills by using CollabU. We are assessing our project through pre and post surveys, looking at students’ mindset, belonging in the discipline, and group work preferences. 

Ryan SullivanProfessorMechanical Engineering, ChemistryCourse: 24-291, 24-381, 09-291, 09-381: Environmental Systems on a Changing Planet (plus STEM Addendum)
DEI Goal: Fostering a strong sense of student belonging in environmental science regardless of what discipline students are coming from.
This is an introductory course to the interdisciplinary field of environmental science that explores how complex natural environmental systems function and thus support all life, and how human societies are interfering with environmental systems. My project focuses on effectively teaching the diverse range of student discipline backgrounds present in this course where STEM and non-STEM majors explore environmental science together. A 3-unit STEM Addendum course was created to allow STEM majors to explore the science and engineering topics covered in the main course to more technical and quantitative depth while still having all students learning together in the main course. I use a learn before lecture pedagogy throughout so that students are prepared to discuss questions posed to them that help them assess their understanding of the key concepts. I also ask them to submit their muddiest points from each week so we can address those questions. To promote healthy open dialogue during class we first discuss what the goals of engaging in dialogue versus debate or even discussion are.  We then use dialogue as students respond to opening questions on each unit and questions on the pre-class material they had watched and read, as well as in response to discussion prompts on the Canvas forum. Clicker poll questions are also used to allow the entire class to respond. The focus is on recognizing the knowledge value contributed by multi-disciplinary perspectives to understand complex environmental systems.Students are also regularly asked to identify what important roles different disciplines contribute in addressing the global cases study examples explored. I implemented a survey that evaluates each student's sense of belonging in environmental science at the beginning and end of the semester, and students are routinely asked to reflect on their own experiences and thinking regarding sustainability.

Carnegie Mellon University - Qatar
Nui VatanasakdakulAssociate Teaching ProfessorInformation SystemsCourse: 67-352 E-business and Design Thinking 
 
DEI Goal: Enriching students’ learning experiences, motivation and engagement, through an exploration of their cultural and regional background.
This is an elective course targeting students in the Information Systems major, and Tech Entrepreneurship minor. Students learn about how digital platforms and businesses inter-play to produce innovative e-business models, processes, products and services in various contexts from both strategic and hands-on operational perspectives. In the final project, students will set up their own social commerce business in Qatar. My project is designed to promote more inclusive awareness about diversity and the gender gap in entrepreneurship in social commerce education, particularly in a middle eastern context. I aim to create effective pedagogy in fostering knowledge and understanding on the sensitive gender culture in order to empower female entrepreneurs in the social commerce domain. I assign pre-work to prepare students to discuss gender in entrepreneurship in a global context. Then during our discussion I aim to develop their understanding and anticipation on what might be challenges in gender gap and in social commerce entrepreneurship in Qatar. Then, while implementing their social commerce business, students are asked to apply what they have learned to their business practice, and to observe and reflect on their experiences in the report. I am using the mid semester survey to ask students about their awareness of diversity and gender in social commerce entrepreneurship. At the end of semester, I am using the reflective method for students to analyze their learning experiences in a report. 

Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences
Nynke NiezinkAssistant ProfessorStatistics and Data ScienceCourse: 36-226 Introduction to Statistical Inference
 
DEI Goal: Helping students hear and engage with diverse perspectives and experiences through exposures to statisticians and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, and more intense collaboration between students. 
My course is a large undergraduate class, primarily taken by sophomores and juniors, from a wide range of backgrounds. This course is the second half of a year-long sequence in probability and mathematical statistics. Using the foundations from their probability class, students in this course learn the basic ideas and methods for analyzing data and making inferences about an unknown population based on a data sample. My project is aimed at improving students' sense of belonging in my class and in Statistics. I encourage student connections by introducing recitation sections to the course where they are encouraged to collaborate. I am also improving the inclusiveness of 36-226 by showing the students that statistics has many faces, both as a field and in terms of those who practice it, through new homework problems that introduce students to statisticians and practitioners in short video interviews and related exercises. I am using a survey to assess students' sense of belonging as well as their social network ties within the course context at the beginning and end of the semester. 

Mellon College of Science
Lynley DoonanAssistant Teaching ProfessorBiological Sciences

 
Amanda WillardDirector of Undergraduate StudiesBiological SciencesCourse: 03-117 Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences 

 DEI Goal: Increasing our students’ sense of belonging and normalizing setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist.
Frontiers, Analysis, and Discovery in Biological Sciences is a first-year, semester long research-based laboratory course. Students work in teams on a research question to learn laboratory techniques followed by final projects in which they ultimately design a research experiment, implement it, analyze the data, and present the results. Our goal is to increase our students’ sense of belonging and normalize setbacks as part of the journey to becoming a scientist so that when our first year students encounter setbacks and failures they are more resilient and feel empowered to persevere in their journey to becoming a scientist. We want to highlight that the path to becoming a scientist is often nonlinear, everyone experiences setbacks and failures, and overcoming them is how you succeed. We ask students to reflect on what setbacks they have faced in the lab and how their laboratory technique has improved as a result; we further highlight this during sharing activities in which upper-class students in other laboratory courses share setbacks they have experienced and discuss how they overcame them. We also invite departmental faculty guest speakers to describe their journey to becoming a scientist and setbacks they encountered in addition to showcasing the research that they do. We are using a survey to assess students’ relationship to failure, whether they see themselves as a scientist, and how they describe the characteristics of a scientist. 

Tepper School of Business 
Abbe DepretisAssistant Teaching Professor Course: 45-893 Communicating DEI in the Workplace 

 
DEI Goal: Teaching DEI practices to apply in the workplace and in their own work and organizations.
Communicating DEI in the Workplace is a mini course designed to introduce the concepts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to our part time MBA students in a meaningful and dedicated way and to develop their communication skills within this critical area of the business world. By using students' own stories and perspectives, the class aims to include their voices and combine their experiences with the narratives of others to show a cohesive picture of DEI in the workplace. We will consider ways to communicate the concepts and applications of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion beginning with the hiring process and moving into the workplace, including teamwork, interpersonal interactions, and innovation, and culminating in a final DEI initiative for their organization. 

John GasperAssociate Teaching Professor Course: 73-348 Behavioral Economics

 DEI Goal: Increasing students’ sense of belonging in the classroom and field, and engaging students in discussing issues of diversity and inclusion.
This course is an elective and intended to give future managers, consultants, and policy makers an introduction to the insights and applications of behavioral economics. It draws together research from psychology and economics to address topics including heuristics and biases in inference and prediction, risk perceptions and attitudes, and the roles of group processes in decision making. Through this fellowship, my aim is to enhance awareness and understanding of how issues surrounding diversity, equity, and inclusion have limited the data we use to inform our understanding of economic processes. By integrating the conversation of diversity in subject pools into material earlier in the course, it is my hope that students feel more comfortable engaging with discussion related to diversity and inclusion. I am also redesigning several assessments in the course to highlight the role of research subjects from different backgrounds. Often this diversity, or lack thereof, is a crucial yet overlooked aspect in generalizing the results of research. I am scaffolding the development of the students’ final replication project to highlight the diversity of their subjects and the role that this might play in what we “know” in the social sciences. I plan on measuring the change in a sense of belonging and sensitivity to DEI issues via pre- and post-tests. 

Bryan RoutledgeAssociate Professor Course: 70-106 Business Science
 
 
DEI Goal: Building shared community guidelines for discussion, to help students discuss how DEI issues impact and are impacted by business decision making, and how business science tools can apply directly to improving the world.
The goal of the course is to introduce undergraduates to the academic study of business. The content of the class is to give students experience with the three core ”lenses” used to study and advance the science and practice of business: the mathematics of optimization, economics, and organization behavior. Typically, these concepts are new to students. My goal is to create a more inclusive classroom that does not rely on “background'' engagement where students are mostly passive. Second, DEI issues are ubiquitous in business, so we are making space to address them in the context of the course material. We are spending time discussing our communities guidelines and norms (linked to the business topic of an organization's culture). Each assignment has a tie to a DEI issue where we discuss the connection to business as well as how business science tools can impact DEI issues both negatively and positively. We are using a survey to ask about students' sense of belonging at the beginning and end of the semester.
