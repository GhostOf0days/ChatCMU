Audio System Overview
Tom’s audio is an off the shelf system provided by Give Kids The World.
 
We assembled the parts from components they already had (behringer mixer) with new ones (JBL speakers) to give Tom the most realistic robust audio we could.
If running the dance party with no audio, there is a 1/4″ headphone jack to the left of the touch screen monitor.  This could be used to play custom music during the dance party.  Tom will perform (dance) for about 30 seconds before entering a staring contest with Joel the troll.
 
This gives whoever is running the audio / dance party to host the event without any additional wear and tear on Tom.
