Students in the Intelligent Environments minor are concerned with the design and realization of interactive 3D spaces – both physical and virtual.  Students in this minor can explore how information and energy flow between physical, electronic, and computational spaces. By moving through space and time, we make sense of the world using our bodies.

                                                  ›              Intelligent Environments
                            


 Intelligent Environments
Students in the Intelligent Environments minor are concerned with the design and realization of interactive 3D spaces – both physical and virtual.  Students in this minor can explore how information and energy flow between physical, electronic, and computational spaces. By moving through space and time, we make sense of the world using our bodies. Just as we shape the environments around us, they in turn shape our experiences and senses, making us mindful of the need to develop responsible, equitable and inclusive environments. As a student in Intelligent Environments, through experimentation, hands-on learning, reflection, and documentation, you will learn:

  Analytical skills for the visualization and realization interactive spaces
 Principles of multimodal and embodied interactions
  3-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) for visualization, simulation, and fabrication
  The cultural context, and social and environmental implications of constructed environments

Integrate Technology and Life



IDeATe
                                      ›              Undergraduate Programs
    
                                                  ›              Intelligent Environments
                            


 Intelligent Environments
Students in the Intelligent Environments minor are concerned with the design and realization of interactive 3D spaces – both physical and virtual.  Students in this minor can explore how information and energy flow between physical, electronic, and computational spaces. By moving through space and time, we make sense of the world using our bodies. Just as we shape the environments around us, they in turn shape our experiences and senses, making us mindful of the need to develop responsible, equitable and inclusive environments. As a student in Intelligent Environments, through experimentation, hands-on learning, reflection, and documentation, you will learn:

  Analytical skills for the visualization and realization interactive spaces
 Principles of multimodal and embodied interactions
  3-dimensional computer-aided design (CAD) for visualization, simulation, and fabrication
  The cultural context, and social and environmental implications of constructed environments
