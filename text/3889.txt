Reports of suspected violations may be made confidentially, and even anonymously, although the more information that is given, the easier it is to investigate the reports. A report of a suspected violation is a service to the university and will not in itself jeopardize employment with the university.  That is, no person who makes a good faith report of a suspected violation will be reprimanded or retaliated against in any way.
