 The iii Experience: In Their Own Words


 
 "As I got to know my classmates and meet my professor during our synchronous classes, there was really a sense of connection. I really do feel like I have a strong sense of community within the classroom, even though it is virtual."   - Menelik Lewis, (iii Online Student)



 
 "There are few institutions that can provide depth in design, business, and engineering at the graduate level like CMU. For me, the MIIPS program offered a unique combination of educational excellence in all three fields with a passionate, exceptional student base at a university that has a deep history of fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration."   - Catherine Sun (MIIPS '05) 



 
 "I looked at MBA programs, however, I felt that they were not focused on software engineering as a discipline. The MSSM program closed the gap for me. It is an MBA for software engineers. Using software engineering skills, I am able to make users' lives better by building useful products for them."  - Shabbir Suterwala (MSSM '11)

 "There are few institutions that can provide depth in design, business, and engineering at the graduate level like CMU. For me, the MIIPS program offered a unique combination of educational excellence in all three fields with a passionate, exceptional student base at a university that has a deep history of fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration."   - Catherine Sun (MIIPS '05)

 "I looked at MBA programs, however, I felt that they were not focused on software engineering as a discipline. The MSSM program closed the gap for me. It is an MBA for software engineers. Using software engineering skills, I am able to make users' lives better by building useful products for them."  - Shabbir Suterwala (MSSM '11)
