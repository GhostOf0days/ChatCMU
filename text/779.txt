Undergraduate programs

Materials Science and Engineering is an interdisciplinary field that combines engineering, chemistry, and physics to solve real-world problems that impact nearly every industry. At CMU, our objective is to prepare students to become leaders with the ability to adapt to the ever-changing technologies facing today's engineers.








Master of Science programs

MSE offers seven different areas of study: Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering,
dual degree master of science programs, Master of Science in Engineering and Technology Innovation Management,
Master of Science in Computational Materials Science and Engineering, Master of Science in Materials Science, Master of Science in Additive Manufacturing affiliated program, and Master in Energy Science and Technology and Policy.








Doctor of Philosophy program

The Doctoral degree emphasizes the creation of new knowledge through extensive independent research, including the formulation of hypotheses, the interpretation of phenomena revealed by research, and the extraction of general principles upon which predictions can be made.
