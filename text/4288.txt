I research and teach in American culture and cultural theory. My special interests in American culture include film, popular music, and fiction from the late nineteenth to the twenty-first century. My theoretical interests concern Marxism, media theory, and the politics of literary form. I am the author of Michel Foucault, Creating American Civilization: A Genealogy of American Literature as an Academic Discipline, Modern Love: Romance, Intimacy, and the Marriage Crisis, John Sayles, and Rock Star: The Making of Cultural Icons from Elvis to Springsteen. I have just completed a study of realism in print fiction, film, theater, and TV in the U. S. during the 20th century. Current projects include a history of theory in literary studies in the U.S. and editing The World of Leonard Cohen for Cambridge University Press.Ph.D., Indiana University MA, Indiana University BA, New College of Hofstra UniversityCV

Bio

I research and teach in American culture and cultural theory. My special interests in American culture include film, popular music, and fiction from the late nineteenth to the twenty-first century. My theoretical interests concern Marxism, media theory, and the politics of literary form. I am the author of Michel Foucault, Creating American Civilization: A Genealogy of American Literature as an Academic Discipline, Modern Love: Romance, Intimacy, and the Marriage Crisis, John Sayles, and Rock Star: The Making of Cultural Icons from Elvis to Springsteen. I have just completed a study of realism in print fiction, film, theater, and TV in the U. S. during the 20th century. Current projects include a history of theory in literary studies in the U.S. and editing The World of Leonard Cohen for Cambridge University Press.

Bio

I research and teach in American culture and cultural theory. My special interests in American culture include film, popular music, and fiction from the late nineteenth to the twenty-first century. My theoretical interests concern Marxism, media theory, and the politics of literary form. I am the author of Michel Foucault, Creating American Civilization: A Genealogy of American Literature as an Academic Discipline, Modern Love: Romance, Intimacy, and the Marriage Crisis, John Sayles, and Rock Star: The Making of Cultural Icons from Elvis to Springsteen. I have just completed a study of realism in print fiction, film, theater, and TV in the U. S. during the 20th century. Current projects include a history of theory in literary studies in the U.S. and editing The World of Leonard Cohen for Cambridge University Press.

Bio

I research and teach in American culture and cultural theory. My special interests in American culture include film, popular music, and fiction from the late nineteenth to the twenty-first century. My theoretical interests concern Marxism, media theory, and the politics of literary form. I am the author of Michel Foucault, Creating American Civilization: A Genealogy of American Literature as an Academic Discipline, Modern Love: Romance, Intimacy, and the Marriage Crisis, John Sayles, and Rock Star: The Making of Cultural Icons from Elvis to Springsteen. I have just completed a study of realism in print fiction, film, theater, and TV in the U. S. during the 20th century. Current projects include a history of theory in literary studies in the U.S. and editing The World of Leonard Cohen for Cambridge University Press.
