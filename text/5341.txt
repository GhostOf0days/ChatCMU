Miracle Workshop 2.0 is a collaborative project with Give Kids The World Village, a nonprofit resort in Central Florida that provides cost-free vacations to children with life-threatening illnesses and their families.  GKTW has reached out to us because they had a hand mechanized puppet that had not been in use due to safety reasons.

Our goal this term is to finish Tom’s engineering while putting him through rigorous testing cycles before his installation.  Additionally, we are iterating on his show content while cleaning and smoothing his animations to hopefully create a more enchanting experience while reducing unnecessary wear.
