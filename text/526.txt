There are dozens of public printers across campus. All have black & white (B&W), letter-sized (8.5 x 11) double-sided (duplex) printing. Some offer scanning, copying, color printing and tabloid (11 x 17) paper sizes. For specialized printing services, visit Tartan Ink.To find the printer closest to you with the options you need use our Google map or reference the chart below.Note: If a printer is jammed or out of toner, check the printer's display to determine if you are able to resolve the error message yourself. If you are still unable to print, contact the support person for that printer. Printers in Porter Hall, Hamburg Hall and Hamerschlag Hall may not have print release stations. To release a print job sent to a printer that does not have a release station, use the Campus Printing Web Portal.

 Printer Locations & Support
There are dozens of public printers across campus. All have black & white (B&W), letter-sized (8.5 x 11) double-sided (duplex) printing. Some offer scanning, copying, color printing and tabloid (11 x 17) paper sizes. For specialized printing services, visit Tartan Ink.
To find the printer closest to you with the options you need use our Google map or reference the chart below.
Note: If a printer is jammed or out of toner, check the printer's display to determine if you are able to resolve the error message yourself. If you are still unable to print, contact the support person for that printer.

 Printer Locations & Support
There are dozens of public printers across campus. All have black & white (B&W), letter-sized (8.5 x 11) double-sided (duplex) printing. Some offer scanning, copying, color printing and tabloid (11 x 17) paper sizes. For specialized printing services, visit Tartan Ink.
To find the printer closest to you with the options you need use our Google map or reference the chart below.
Note: If a printer is jammed or out of toner, check the printer's display to determine if you are able to resolve the error message yourself. If you are still unable to print, contact the support person for that printer.
