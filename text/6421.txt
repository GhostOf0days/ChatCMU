Announcing New Online Platform for Student Exhibitions
Posted on April 15, 2020
The School of Art is pleased to announce a new online hub for student exhibitions, cmuschoolofartexhibits.online. On view now, see culminating projects from Professor Suzie Silver’s Music Video/Visual Music course, remote figure drawing from Professor Andrew Johnson’s Drawing in No Time course, and studies from Professor Clayton Merrell’s Color course.
Exhibiting student work has always been important for the School, both as a means to showcase student accomplishments and as an educational tool for students to learn from one another. Traditionally, most exhibitions center around the College of Fine Arts building, from quick figure drawing studies lining the hallway, to video and electronic work screening in the foyer, to curated student exhibitions and projects in the Ellis Gallery. During remote learning, this new virtual gallery allows the School to continue this important practice, and gives visitors the opportunity to view student work no matter where in the world they may be.
