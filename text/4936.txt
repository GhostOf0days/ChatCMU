Employee resource groups (ERGs) are groups formed by members of an organization with the overarching purpose to unite individuals to a common cause and to provide a structured framework for awareness opportunities for members. Additionally, ERGs serve the purpose of acting as a conduit for outreach efforts for the local community and for other campus initiatives. To join an ERG, please submit a membership form. Individual membership in ERGs is strictly voluntary; open to all interested individuals; and promotes diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Refer to the ERG Guidelines [pdf] for more information.The mission of the employee resource groups (ERGs) is to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion as a strategic tool to encourage cultural awareness and community engagement within Carnegie Mellon University. The ERGs will act as spaces that influence a non-bias culture and encourage inclusive collaboration, equity and awareness, while understanding the thoughts and ideas of the various racial, ethnic and generational members of campus.In order for ERGs to be successful, CMU's leadership must remain engaged and committed to the long-term sustainability of the groups. To encourage this, a senior advisory committee (SAC) made up of vice presidents, vice provosts and deans has been created. The SAC signals to employees that CMU is committed to diversity and inclusion. SAC members serve as champions who promote ERGs to other leaders and staff as well as provide guidance, funding, mentoring, visibility, networking, and assistance in reaching goals and communicating progress. This support will aid the ERGs in their achievements, credibility and longevity.The staff ombudsperson provides guidance and resources to help facilitate the establishment of ERGs. They also provide structure to ensure successful establishment, organization and longevity, and facilitate funding requests. Once established, it is the ERG's responsibility to determine and adhere to the operational and funding policies established by the group.CMU has established employee affinity groups and a multitude of student organizations that represent a wide range of interests. For example, the Carnegie Mellon Women's Association connects and supports campus community members through networking opportunities, social gatherings and educational programming throughout the year.Co-leads and representatives from CMU's employee resource groups were joined by Scotty Dog while hosting a table during the CMU Community Picnic on May 17, 2023.Jennifer Pablonis, Harold Ennulat, Jay Marano and Brandon Davis pose with a shirt signed by Special Olympians.

Employee Resource Groups
Employee resource groups (ERGs) are groups formed by members of an organization with the overarching purpose to unite individuals to a common cause and to provide a structured framework for awareness opportunities for members. Additionally, ERGs serve the purpose of acting as a conduit for outreach efforts for the local community and for other campus initiatives. 
To join an ERG, please submit a membership form. Individual membership in ERGs is strictly voluntary; open to all interested individuals; and promotes diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Refer to the ERG Guidelines [pdf] for more information.
Mission Statement
The mission of the employee resource groups (ERGs) is to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion as a strategic tool to encourage cultural awareness and community engagement within Carnegie Mellon University. The ERGs will act as spaces that influence a non-bias culture and encourage inclusive collaboration, equity and awareness, while understanding the thoughts and ideas of the various racial, ethnic and generational members of campus.
How ERGs Work: Executive Sponsorship and Staff Ombudsperson's Role
In order for ERGs to be successful, CMU's leadership must remain engaged and committed to the long-term sustainability of the groups. To encourage this, a senior advisory committee (SAC) made up of vice presidents, vice provosts and deans has been created. The SAC signals to employees that CMU is committed to diversity and inclusion. SAC members serve as champions who promote ERGs to other leaders and staff as well as provide guidance, funding, mentoring, visibility, networking, and assistance in reaching goals and communicating progress. This support will aid the ERGs in their achievements, credibility and longevity.
The staff ombudsperson provides guidance and resources to help facilitate the establishment of ERGs. They also provide structure to ensure successful establishment, organization and longevity, and facilitate funding requests. Once established, it is the ERG's responsibility to determine and adhere to the operational and funding policies established by the group.
Other Opportunities
CMU has established employee affinity groups and a multitude of student organizations that represent a wide range of interests. For example, the Carnegie Mellon Women's Association connects and supports campus community members through networking opportunities, social gatherings and educational programming throughout the year.

Employee Resource Groups
Employee resource groups (ERGs) are groups formed by members of an organization with the overarching purpose to unite individuals to a common cause and to provide a structured framework for awareness opportunities for members. Additionally, ERGs serve the purpose of acting as a conduit for outreach efforts for the local community and for other campus initiatives. 
To join an ERG, please submit a membership form. Individual membership in ERGs is strictly voluntary; open to all interested individuals; and promotes diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Refer to the ERG Guidelines [pdf] for more information.
Mission Statement
The mission of the employee resource groups (ERGs) is to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion as a strategic tool to encourage cultural awareness and community engagement within Carnegie Mellon University. The ERGs will act as spaces that influence a non-bias culture and encourage inclusive collaboration, equity and awareness, while understanding the thoughts and ideas of the various racial, ethnic and generational members of campus.
How ERGs Work: Executive Sponsorship and Staff Ombudsperson's Role
In order for ERGs to be successful, CMU's leadership must remain engaged and committed to the long-term sustainability of the groups. To encourage this, a senior advisory committee (SAC) made up of vice presidents, vice provosts and deans has been created. The SAC signals to employees that CMU is committed to diversity and inclusion. SAC members serve as champions who promote ERGs to other leaders and staff as well as provide guidance, funding, mentoring, visibility, networking, and assistance in reaching goals and communicating progress. This support will aid the ERGs in their achievements, credibility and longevity.
The staff ombudsperson provides guidance and resources to help facilitate the establishment of ERGs. They also provide structure to ensure successful establishment, organization and longevity, and facilitate funding requests. Once established, it is the ERG's responsibility to determine and adhere to the operational and funding policies established by the group.
Other Opportunities
CMU has established employee affinity groups and a multitude of student organizations that represent a wide range of interests. For example, the Carnegie Mellon Women's Association connects and supports campus community members through networking opportunities, social gatherings and educational programming throughout the year.

Employee Resource Groups
Employee resource groups (ERGs) are groups formed by members of an organization with the overarching purpose to unite individuals to a common cause and to provide a structured framework for awareness opportunities for members. Additionally, ERGs serve the purpose of acting as a conduit for outreach efforts for the local community and for other campus initiatives. 
To join an ERG, please submit a membership form. Individual membership in ERGs is strictly voluntary; open to all interested individuals; and promotes diversity, equity and inclusiveness. Refer to the ERG Guidelines [pdf] for more information.
Mission Statement
The mission of the employee resource groups (ERGs) is to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion as a strategic tool to encourage cultural awareness and community engagement within Carnegie Mellon University. The ERGs will act as spaces that influence a non-bias culture and encourage inclusive collaboration, equity and awareness, while understanding the thoughts and ideas of the various racial, ethnic and generational members of campus.
How ERGs Work: Executive Sponsorship and Staff Ombudsperson's Role
In order for ERGs to be successful, CMU's leadership must remain engaged and committed to the long-term sustainability of the groups. To encourage this, a senior advisory committee (SAC) made up of vice presidents, vice provosts and deans has been created. The SAC signals to employees that CMU is committed to diversity and inclusion. SAC members serve as champions who promote ERGs to other leaders and staff as well as provide guidance, funding, mentoring, visibility, networking, and assistance in reaching goals and communicating progress. This support will aid the ERGs in their achievements, credibility and longevity.
The staff ombudsperson provides guidance and resources to help facilitate the establishment of ERGs. They also provide structure to ensure successful establishment, organization and longevity, and facilitate funding requests. Once established, it is the ERG's responsibility to determine and adhere to the operational and funding policies established by the group.
Other Opportunities
CMU has established employee affinity groups and a multitude of student organizations that represent a wide range of interests. For example, the Carnegie Mellon Women's Association connects and supports campus community members through networking opportunities, social gatherings and educational programming throughout the year.
