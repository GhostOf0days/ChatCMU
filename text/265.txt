Empowering the Next Generation of CMU Women
Scholarship support from alumnae helps exceptional students succeed







By Sarah Burke






As a student, Janet Felmeth (MM 1959) received scholarship support that opened up the possibility for her to attend college.
Now she’s opening doors for the next generation of Carnegie Mellon University women.
“I feel it’s important to give back,” she says. “Without the financial support I received, I would not have been able to get the education that has made such a difference in my life.”
A home economics major, Janet has been a loyal donor to the Margaret Morrison Scholarship Fund since it was established 20 years ago. Like Janet, most supporters of this scholarship fund are alumnae of Margaret Morrison Carnegie College — the women’s college that became a part of CMU in 1973.
Janet’s fond memories of her Margaret Morrison experience — and the “solid, wonderful gals” she met there — inspire her to continue giving back. As a commuter, she treasured the time she was able to spend living on campus in the Home Management House, learning about menu planning, shopping and food preparation with her classmates.
She says her college education provided a necessary foundation for her career in the natural gas and home appliance industries, where she had many opportunities for travel and public speaking.
“I hope this scholarship allows today’s students to follow their interests,” Janet says. “I want to help them have an interesting career as I did — and a satisfying life as a result of their education.” Janet Felmeth
CMU junior Maya Brown is one of the women carrying on the “Maggie Murph” legacy today as a recipient of the Margaret Morrison Scholarship.
“Studying biological sciences at CMU has been a great fit for my natural curiosity and constant desire to understand the world around me,” Maya says.
While Maya is working toward a career in scientific research, this remarkable student is just as comfortable performing in Kiltie Band as she is performing experiments in a lab.
“I have been playing the trombone since I was in third grade, so I knew that I needed music to continue to be a part of my life,” Maya says. “Kiltie Band has become like a second family away from home.”
This is Maya’s third year receiving this scholarship, which she says made a CMU education attainable for her and her family.
“When I found out that I had been chosen to receive a scholarship that was so dedicated to helping women succeed, I felt unbelievably honored,” she says. “These donors are true heroes.”

Empowering the Next Generation of CMU Women
Scholarship support from alumnae helps exceptional students succeed







By Sarah Burke






As a student, Janet Felmeth (MM 1959) received scholarship support that opened up the possibility for her to attend college.
Now she’s opening doors for the next generation of Carnegie Mellon University women.
“I feel it’s important to give back,” she says. “Without the financial support I received, I would not have been able to get the education that has made such a difference in my life.”
A home economics major, Janet has been a loyal donor to the Margaret Morrison Scholarship Fund since it was established 20 years ago. Like Janet, most supporters of this scholarship fund are alumnae of Margaret Morrison Carnegie College — the women’s college that became a part of CMU in 1973.
Janet’s fond memories of her Margaret Morrison experience — and the “solid, wonderful gals” she met there — inspire her to continue giving back. As a commuter, she treasured the time she was able to spend living on campus in the Home Management House, learning about menu planning, shopping and food preparation with her classmates.
She says her college education provided a necessary foundation for her career in the natural gas and home appliance industries, where she had many opportunities for travel and public speaking.
“I hope this scholarship allows today’s students to follow their interests,” Janet says. “I want to help them have an interesting career as I did — and a satisfying life as a result of their education.” Janet Felmeth
CMU junior Maya Brown is one of the women carrying on the “Maggie Murph” legacy today as a recipient of the Margaret Morrison Scholarship.
“Studying biological sciences at CMU has been a great fit for my natural curiosity and constant desire to understand the world around me,” Maya says.
While Maya is working toward a career in scientific research, this remarkable student is just as comfortable performing in Kiltie Band as she is performing experiments in a lab.
“I have been playing the trombone since I was in third grade, so I knew that I needed music to continue to be a part of my life,” Maya says. “Kiltie Band has become like a second family away from home.”
This is Maya’s third year receiving this scholarship, which she says made a CMU education attainable for her and her family.
“When I found out that I had been chosen to receive a scholarship that was so dedicated to helping women succeed, I felt unbelievably honored,” she says. “These donors are true heroes.”
