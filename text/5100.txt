The School of Drama Graduate Costume Design Option produces innovative leaders in the design and production fields of clothing for the stage, television, and film industries.Costume designers consider the human condition and pursue design for theater, dance, opera, film and television. Dynamic training engages critical analysis along with serious artistic development and the study of the many materials and techniques of the field.

Our students are artists and critical thinkers— disciplined multi-taskers who are self-motivated and mature. They possess a realistic knowledge of the business, open positive attitudes, active inquisitive minds and the passionate yet pragmatic goal of entering the profession upon graduation. 

Graduate Costume Design students are mentored by a team of leading professionals in all facets of costume design and costume production. Students learn and apply skills needed for a specialized career in the field.Costume Design students are offered both analytical and artistic coursework to develop holistic artistry. Script analysis and character development balance investigations of the world and style in which the student chooses to design the play.  Discreet mini courses exist in Costume Design for the Classics and Costume Design with Music.  Intensive historical surveys of clothing, and architecture and décor provide building blocks for design. Rigorous studio instruction in Drawing, Painting and Costume Rendering within School of Drama may be augmented with art and photography courses in the Schools of Art, Design and Architecture.

Essential to the School of Drama Costume program is our philosophical belief that Costume Production be taught alongside Costume Design. Students not only gain important practical knowledge about how they can work withand what they can expect fromtheir future production staffs, but also they learn marketable skills indraping, tailoring, millinery, dyeing and painting, and a constellation of craft courses.

Coursework is also available in Scenography, Design for the Camera, and a multi disciplinary course involving media and experimentation called Future Stages. 

Annual resource trips to New York are made with faculty. International students and activities are encouraged through participation in the Prague Quadrennial of Performance Space and Design and international summer internships.

Essential to the School of Drama Costume program is our philosophical belief that Costume Production be taught alongside Costume Design. Students not only gain important practical knowledge about how they can work withand what they can expect fromtheir future production staffs, but also they learn marketable skills indraping, tailoring, millinery, dyeing and painting, and a constellation of craft courses.

Coursework is also available in Scenography, Design for the Camera, and a multi disciplinary course involving media and experimentation called Future Stages. 

Annual resource trips to New York are made with faculty. International students and activities are encouraged through participation in the Prague Quadrennial of Performance Space and Design and international summer internships. Renowned alumni, national and international guests present workshops and portfolio reviews annually.




Costume Design students are offered both analytical and artistic coursework to develop holistic artistry. Script analysis and character development balance investigations of the world and style in which the student chooses to design the play.  Discreet mini courses exist in Costume Design for the Classics and Costume Design with Music.  Intensive historical surveys of clothing, and architecture and décor provide building blocks for design. Rigorous studio instruction in Drawing, Painting and Costume Rendering within School of Drama may be augmented with art and photography courses in the Schools of Art, Design and Architecture.
