Students interested in the minor should contact the IDeATe advisor to discuss curriculum and to make a loose plan of study. All students are welcome to take IDeATe's Soft Technologies courses to fulfill requirements or to explore an area of interest. Pursuing the minor is not required to take the courses.The Soft Technologies faculty represent Carnegie Mellon's expertise in Art, Engineering, and Computer Science. They carefully oversee the collaboration of students while delivering the IDeATe Soft Technologies courses. Learn more about participating faculty here.

IDeATe Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology



 
Weave together traditions and technology



IDeATe
                                      ›              Undergraduate Programs
    
                                                  ›              Soft Technologies
                            


 Soft Technologies
Soft technologies is an emerging field of robotics, the arts, craft, and engineering with far-reaching commercial, research, and social implications. Individual disciplines address components of this burgeoning field, but the IDeATe Soft Technologies minor helps students integrate the pieces to be able to make significant contributions to this developing sphere. Through the courses in the minor, students weave together a rich set of established and experimental techniques in traditional soft materials (such as fibers and textiles) and new soft materials (such as current hybrid and dynamic materials) to design and create a variety of forms with applications ranging from novel to practical. Students explore the unique qualities that soft material technologies afford in design and interaction in relationship to environments and the human body— responsiveness, adaptivity, flexibility, sensitivity, morphing, and biomimicry. Students will engage in project-based inquiry, using research, experimentation, making, and reflection to inform their creativity and to develop critical perspectives. Students will be able to envision their own projects and develop sensitivities to the breadth and limitations of soft technologies.
Through coursework in the minor, you will gain skills and competencies in: 

Manipulating traditional soft materials (such as fibers and textiles) and new soft materials (such as current  hybrid and dynamic materials).
Constructing 3-dimensional forms from 2-dimensional planes.
Articulating material and conceptual choices in discussions and critiques.
Analyzing the relationships between materials, form, use, and content integral to making.
Researching and engaging with contemporary and/or historical precedents in the field

How to Participate
IDeATe collaborates with the Robotics Institute to offer an undergraduate minor in Soft Technologies, which is open to students from any major. Students interested in the minor should contact the IDeATe advisor to discuss curriculum and to make a loose plan of study. 
All students are welcome to take IDeATe's Soft Technologies courses to fulfill requirements or to explore an area of interest. Pursuing the minor is not required to take the courses.

  
 Soft Technologies Faculty
The Soft Technologies faculty represent Carnegie Mellon's expertise in Art, Engineering, and Computer Science. They carefully oversee the collaboration of students while delivering the IDeATe Soft Technologies courses. Learn more about participating faculty here.

IDeATe Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology

 
Weave together traditions and technology



IDeATe
                                      ›              Undergraduate Programs
    
                                                  ›              Soft Technologies
                            


 Soft Technologies
Soft technologies is an emerging field of robotics, the arts, craft, and engineering with far-reaching commercial, research, and social implications. Individual disciplines address components of this burgeoning field, but the IDeATe Soft Technologies minor helps students integrate the pieces to be able to make significant contributions to this developing sphere. Through the courses in the minor, students weave together a rich set of established and experimental techniques in traditional soft materials (such as fibers and textiles) and new soft materials (such as current hybrid and dynamic materials) to design and create a variety of forms with applications ranging from novel to practical. Students explore the unique qualities that soft material technologies afford in design and interaction in relationship to environments and the human body— responsiveness, adaptivity, flexibility, sensitivity, morphing, and biomimicry. Students will engage in project-based inquiry, using research, experimentation, making, and reflection to inform their creativity and to develop critical perspectives. Students will be able to envision their own projects and develop sensitivities to the breadth and limitations of soft technologies.
Through coursework in the minor, you will gain skills and competencies in: 

Manipulating traditional soft materials (such as fibers and textiles) and new soft materials (such as current  hybrid and dynamic materials).
Constructing 3-dimensional forms from 2-dimensional planes.
Articulating material and conceptual choices in discussions and critiques.
Analyzing the relationships between materials, form, use, and content integral to making.
Researching and engaging with contemporary and/or historical precedents in the field
