Students choose their arts concentration from the following schools in CFA: Architecture, Art, Design, Drama or Music. Students choose their science concentration from among the departments in MCS: Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematical Sciences, Neurobiology or Physics.The BSA curriculum has three main components: general core requirements, fine arts concentration requirements and natural sciences/mathematics concentration requirements. Each student's course of study is structured so they can complete this rigorous program in four years.Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and MCS. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in MCS to guide their focus in the sciences.
