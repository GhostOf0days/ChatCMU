Abstract: In this talk, I will present three experiments that use low-level image statistics to generate high-resolution detailed outputs. In the first experiment, I will use 2D pixels to efficiently mine hard examples for better learning. Simply biasing ray sampling towards hard ray examples enables learning of neural fields with more accurate high-frequency detail in less time. The second experiment leverages 2D pixels to learn a denoising model from the collection of images. This denoising model enables detailed high-frequency outputs from the model trained on low-resolution samples. The final experiment builds a representation of a pixel that contains color and depth information accumulated from multi-views for a particular location and time along a line of sight. This pixel-based representation alongside a multi-layer perceptron allows us to synthesize novel views given a discrete set of multi-view observations as input. The proposed formulation reliably operates on sparse and wide-baseline multi-view images/videos and can be trained efficiently within a few seconds to 10 minutes for hi-res (12MP) content.

Abstract: In this talk, I will present three experiments that use low-level image statistics to generate high-resolution detailed outputs. In the first experiment, I will use 2D pixels to efficiently mine hard examples for better learning. Simply biasing ray sampling towards hard ray examples enables learning of neural fields with more accurate high-frequency detail in less time. The second experiment leverages 2D pixels to learn a denoising model from the collection of images. This denoising model enables detailed high-frequency outputs from the model trained on low-resolution samples. The final experiment builds a representation of a pixel that contains color and depth information accumulated from multi-views for a particular location and time along a line of sight. This pixel-based representation alongside a multi-layer perceptron allows us to synthesize novel views given a discrete set of multi-view observations as input. The proposed formulation reliably operates on sparse and wide-baseline multi-view images/videos and can be trained efficiently within a few seconds to 10 minutes for hi-res (12MP) content.
