Students who are bringing prescription medication are required to bring a lockbox in order to keep that medication secure in the residence hall. Lockboxes can be purchased at office supply stores and most superstores.¬†All medication is expected to be responsibly self-administered by the student.¬†Students are allowed to bring their own over-the-counter medicine.¬†We would also like to remind students to bring their COVID vaccination cards and masks with them in case they need to show proof of vaccination and/or are asked to mask during trips.


What services can University Health Services (UHS) and Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) provide to Pre-College students? 


UHS: Pre-College students can visit UHS when needed. There will be a $25 charge to the student‚Äôs account each time. We strongly encourage students to save the receipt and submit it to their medical insurance company for reimbursement. After initial evaluation, students might be referred to a local medical center for further testing and/or treatment if needed. It is important for students to submit the required and necessary medical/health records during their enrollment process. Due to FERPA, CMU cannot release Pre-College students‚Äô medical/health information to people who are not listed on the student‚Äôs FERPA Waiver Form. Please feel free to visit the UHS website for further information.
CaPS: On-going therapy sessions will not be available for Pre-College students; however, triage services can be provided. If further treatment is needed, CaPS will refer Pre-College students to professionals in the local community.


How safe is Carnegie Mellon University/Pittsburgh?


The Pittsburgh region has, for a long time, had one of the lowest crime rates in the country and remains one of the nation's safest cities. Its crime rate is half of the national metropolitan average; in fact, it is among the lowest of the 24 largest metropolitan areas in the United States.
Student safety is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The university employs a police department whose staff of police officers and security guards patrol the campus 24 hours a day on foot, by car, and by bicycle. Students attending Carnegie Mellon benefit from the cooperative relationship the University Police enjoys with federal, state, county, and city police agencies. The¬†Campus Security Report, which documents crime statistics and security policies over the past 3 years, is available online for more information.
University Police has a Crime Prevention information table present on Opening Day to answer any questions students or their families may have. The Pre-College residential staff works to educate all students on safety procedures and emergency contacts during their time in the program. University Police and the Pre-College senior staff are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Pre-College Programs
                                     ¬†‚Ä∫¬†             Student Experience
                            


 The college experience is more than the classroom experience. It‚Äôs a student experience.
At Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs Pre-College Programs, you will experience what life is like on a college campus. You will learn both inside and outside of the classroom. You will leave better prepared for your future.
 
 Residential Experience
Students will be housed in residence halls that are typically used for Carnegie Mellon first-year undergraduate students. ¬†Each building is staffed with a team of Resident Advisors (RAs) and a managing Community Advisor (CA) who is responsible for creating community and shaping the lived experience. These current Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students or recent CMU grads are selected through an intensive application and interview process. Prior to the arrival of the¬†students, our residential staff receives robust training that gives them the tools needed to bolster a safe, inclusive, and supportive residential experience. Training includes (but is not limited to) conflict resolution, environment inclusivity, programming, supervision, and emergency response.
Housing
Students will have the opportunity to live in Carnegie Mellon's residential communities and experience an authentic college living experience. Most students will live in a double room with a roommate. The rooms are furnished with twin extra-long beds, chests of drawers, desks with chairs, closets, and wastebaskets. Linens (including pillows, sheets, comforters, towels, etc.) and fans are not supplied.¬†  Washers and dryers are available in each of the dorms at no charge. Detergent and any other laundry supplies are not supplied.
Housing Options
Students who are admitted to a Pre-College program will have the opportunity during the enrollment process to share their housing preferences related to their lifestyle including sleep habits, wake-up schedule, and organizational preferences. Students are typically assigned to a double room with another student from their academic program and with similar housing preferences.   Carnegie Mellon‚Äôs Pre-College Programs strive to provide a comfortable and safe housing environment for all students, including students who prefer gender-inclusive housing. Gender-inclusive housing has a limited capacity.Students will be informed of their housing assignment and roommate contact information in mid-June.¬†
Gender-Inclusive Housing

The Pre-College gender-inclusive housing utilizes suite-style rooms that share semi-private bathrooms. The gender-inclusive floors are mixed-gender, while the other housing option is single-gender floors (male or female).

Single Gender Housing

The Pre-College single-gender housing utilizes traditional-style housing with shared bathrooms. Floors are single-gender (male or female), but buildings are mixed-gender.

 
Accommodations
If you believe you are in need of special accommodations for housing or dining, please contact us at 412-268-5914 or¬†pclife@andrew.cmu.edu¬†so that we may discuss your request in advance of arrival.¬†

The main dining hall is located in Resnik House in the Resnik Caf√©. Students will eat breakfast (Monday through Friday) and brunch (Saturday and Sunday) at Resnik Caf√©. All other meals can be eaten at Resnik OR any other dining venue on campus. We refer to meals outside of Resnik as ‚Äútraveling meals‚Äù.

The Commuter¬†student meal plan provides $14 DineExtra funds per day Monday through Friday which is equivalent to $70 per week. The full value of $70 is available for use each Monday and any remaining funds in the account will expire on a weekly basis (the following Saturday at midnight).¬†¬†
Activities and Events
Students have the opportunity to participate in many evening and weekend activities both on- and off-campus. Some activities and events¬†include:

Day trips* to local attractions such as Kennywood Amusement Park, Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, and a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball game.
More than 20 Pre-College club offerings each summer including an introduction to collegiate acapella, art clubs, fitness clubs, sports clubs, gaming clubs, and much more.

Bus transportation is provided.¬†In addition to the Pre-College formal activities, our residential staff will also be responsible for engaging their floor/building community through a variety of building programs and floor activities. ¬†  We also encourage Pre-College students to create their own programming with the aid of residential staff. These can include personal interest/hobby events (like a musical instrument jam or a book club), relaxation events (like yoga or meditation), or inter-cultural events (like Big Questions or society‚Äôs news discussions).

Student safety is a top priority at Carnegie Mellon. The university employs a police department whose staff of police officers and security guards patrol the campus 24 hours a day on foot, by car, and by bicycle. Students attending Carnegie Mellon benefit from the cooperative relationship the University Police enjoys with federal, state, county, and city police agencies. The¬†Campus Security Report, which documents crime statistics and security policies over the past 3 years, is available online for more information.
University Police has a Crime Prevention information table present on Opening Day to answer any questions students or their families may have. The Pre-College residential staff works to educate all students on safety procedures and emergency contacts during their time in the program. University Police and the Pre-College senior staff are on duty 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
