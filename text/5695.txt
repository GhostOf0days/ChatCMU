Bio
            Mario Bergés is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). He is interested in making our built environment more operationally efficient and robust through the use of information and communication technologies, so that it can better deal with future resource constraints and a changing environment. Currently his work largely focuses on developing approximate inference techniques to extract useful information from sensor data coming from civil infrastructure systems, with a particular focus on buildings and energy efficiency.Bergés is the faculty co-director of the Smart Infrastructure Institute at CMU, as well as the director of the Intelligent Infrastructure Research Lab (INFERLab). Among recent awards, he received the Professor of the Year Award by the ASCE Pittsburgh Chapter in 2018, Outstanding Early Career Researcher award from FIATECH in 2010, and the Dean's Early Career Fellowship from CMU in 2015. Bergés received his B.Sc. in 2004 from the Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic; and his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2007 and 2010, respectively, both from Carnegie Mellon University.

Mario Bergés: Using Analytics to Understand Energy Consumption in Buildings
Energy bills show usage as a total number, leaving consumers, building managers and others to wonder which activities or appliances are using the most electricity. Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Mario Bergés is using sensing and analytics to understand energy consumption in buildings and disaggregate the total usage into its parts.

Bio
            Mario Bergés is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). He is interested in making our built environment more operationally efficient and robust through the use of information and communication technologies, so that it can better deal with future resource constraints and a changing environment. Currently his work largely focuses on developing approximate inference techniques to extract useful information from sensor data coming from civil infrastructure systems, with a particular focus on buildings and energy efficiency.Bergés is the faculty co-director of the Smart Infrastructure Institute at CMU, as well as the director of the Intelligent Infrastructure Research Lab (INFERLab). Among recent awards, he received the Professor of the Year Award by the ASCE Pittsburgh Chapter in 2018, Outstanding Early Career Researcher award from FIATECH in 2010, and the Dean's Early Career Fellowship from CMU in 2015. Bergés received his B.Sc. in 2004 from the Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic; and his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2007 and 2010, respectively, both from Carnegie Mellon University.

Mario Bergés: Using Analytics to Understand Energy Consumption in Buildings
Energy bills show usage as a total number, leaving consumers, building managers and others to wonder which activities or appliances are using the most electricity. Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Mario Bergés is using sensing and analytics to understand energy consumption in buildings and disaggregate the total usage into its parts.

Bio
            Mario Bergés is a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). He is interested in making our built environment more operationally efficient and robust through the use of information and communication technologies, so that it can better deal with future resource constraints and a changing environment. Currently his work largely focuses on developing approximate inference techniques to extract useful information from sensor data coming from civil infrastructure systems, with a particular focus on buildings and energy efficiency.Bergés is the faculty co-director of the Smart Infrastructure Institute at CMU, as well as the director of the Intelligent Infrastructure Research Lab (INFERLab). Among recent awards, he received the Professor of the Year Award by the ASCE Pittsburgh Chapter in 2018, Outstanding Early Career Researcher award from FIATECH in 2010, and the Dean's Early Career Fellowship from CMU in 2015. Bergés received his B.Sc. in 2004 from the Instituto Tecnológico de Santo Domingo, in the Dominican Republic; and his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering in 2007 and 2010, respectively, both from Carnegie Mellon University.

Mario Bergés: Using Analytics to Understand Energy Consumption in Buildings
Energy bills show usage as a total number, leaving consumers, building managers and others to wonder which activities or appliances are using the most electricity. Civil and Environmental Engineering Professor Mario Bergés is using sensing and analytics to understand energy consumption in buildings and disaggregate the total usage into its parts.
