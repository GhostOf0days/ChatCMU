 Andrew Carnegie Society
Andrew Carnegie Society members are part of a community of donors committed to the future of Carnegie Mellon University. Your generous support transforms the student experience; makes possible groundbreaking research that accelerates local, national and global impact; and helps attract a highly talented and collaborative community of students, faculty and staff.
Thank you to our ACS members for joining us as we advance CMU’s vision through philanthropy and engagement.
A Legacy of Impact
Since its founding, members of the ACS have advanced countless transformative CMU initiatives like:

ACS Legacy and endowed scholarships that make a CMU education possible for students with a financial need and, for many donors, create an opportunity to build a relationship with the student recipient.

New and increased resources, like the new Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics, that nurture a supportive and welcoming university environment, which helps students achieve their academic, personal and professional goals.

Undergraduate research grants that enable our students, alongside world-class faculty, to advance innovation in their field of study.

 Andrew Carnegie Society
Andrew Carnegie Society members are part of a community of donors committed to the future of Carnegie Mellon University. Your generous support transforms the student experience; makes possible groundbreaking research that accelerates local, national and global impact; and helps attract a highly talented and collaborative community of students, faculty and staff.
Thank you to our ACS members for joining us as we advance CMU’s vision through philanthropy and engagement.
A Legacy of Impact
Since its founding, members of the ACS have advanced countless transformative CMU initiatives like:

ACS Legacy and endowed scholarships that make a CMU education possible for students with a financial need and, for many donors, create an opportunity to build a relationship with the student recipient.

New and increased resources, like the new Highmark Center for Health, Wellness and Athletics, that nurture a supportive and welcoming university environment, which helps students achieve their academic, personal and professional goals.

Undergraduate research grants that enable our students, alongside world-class faculty, to advance innovation in their field of study.
