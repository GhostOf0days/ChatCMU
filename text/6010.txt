MDes Student Launches Website for Aid to Maui
Uluwehi Mills, a second year MDes student at Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Design, recently launched Maui on My Mind, a website that serves as a giving, advocacy, and shopping guide for faraway friends of Maui. After suffering the deadliest natural disaster in the state of Hawaii’s history, Maui on My Mind looks to be a resource for faraway supporters to give with impact, and for Maui residents to have something that’s easy to share with loved ones.
