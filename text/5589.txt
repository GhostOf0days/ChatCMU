You’ve seen it at your own company. Everything is changing. Digitization is not slowing down and data is increasingly being used for strategic decision making across departments. Analytics and technology are becoming more important, not only in meeting the demands of your organization, but in staying agile and responsive to your customers and constituents. Carnegie Mellon's Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program provides you with the tools you need for next generation leadership in any sector. There’s a lot to know. From privacy and security breaches to ethics and cultural issues, there’s a lot of complexity involved in the management of digital teams, assets, communications, products, and services. Where digital transformation goes, huge benefits can follow, as can major risks.CMU’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy and the Tepper School of Business have joined up to develop this visionary executive education program. The program follows a team-based project/case study approach to prepare you to develop and implement a strategic digital roadmap for your home organization.The Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program is designed for directors and senior managers tasked with oversight, management, and implementation of digital transformation initiatives. The program is also relevant for professionals across functions who want to rise to the challenges of a rapidly digitizing society and marketplace. If your department/role is seeing increased digital visibility, responsibility, or exposure — or if you’re looking to build your digital leadership portfolio to evolve into the next phase of your career — then this is the right program for you.Virtual OrientationVirtual orientation: September 6 - 8, 2023 from 12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. ESTVirtual ModulesAll virtual class dates are on Mondays from 4:00 to 9:00 p.m. EST/EDTMid-SessionMid-Session will be held from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. EDTVirtual ModulesAll virtual class dates are on Mondays from 4:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. EDTPracticumPracticum will be held from 9:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. EDTApplication Deadline: August 30, 2023Fee includes all program materials and daily continental breakfast, lunch, and refreshments during on-campus sessions.Optional credit card installment payment plan is available.Please note: Due to the non-credit bearing nature of the Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program, students are unable to apply for tuition assistance, scholarship, or VA benefits.Carnegie Mellon welcomes all individuals to participate in and attend Executive Education programs and events, on campus and/or online, as outlined in the university’s Statement of Assurance.Additionally, we welcome the opportunity to accommodate requests for support for guests, visitors, and alumni with disabilities.

 Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program
As the world becomes increasingly digitized and interconnected, there’s more reason than ever to develop yourself as a digital leader.
 
 You’ve seen it at your own company. Everything is changing. Digitization is not slowing down and data is increasingly being used for strategic decision making across departments. Analytics and technology are becoming more important, not only in meeting the demands of your organization, but in staying agile and responsive to your customers and constituents. Carnegie Mellon's Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program provides you with the tools you need for next generation leadership in any sector. 
There’s a lot to know. From privacy and security breaches to ethics and cultural issues, there’s a lot of complexity involved in the management of digital teams, assets, communications, products, and services. Where digital transformation goes, huge benefits can follow, as can major risks.
CMU’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy and the Tepper School of Business have joined up to develop this visionary executive education program. The program follows a team-based project/case study approach to prepare you to develop and implement a strategic digital roadmap for your home organization.

 Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program
As the world becomes increasingly digitized and interconnected, there’s more reason than ever to develop yourself as a digital leader.
 
 You’ve seen it at your own company. Everything is changing. Digitization is not slowing down and data is increasingly being used for strategic decision making across departments. Analytics and technology are becoming more important, not only in meeting the demands of your organization, but in staying agile and responsive to your customers and constituents. Carnegie Mellon's Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program provides you with the tools you need for next generation leadership in any sector. 
There’s a lot to know. From privacy and security breaches to ethics and cultural issues, there’s a lot of complexity involved in the management of digital teams, assets, communications, products, and services. Where digital transformation goes, huge benefits can follow, as can major risks.
CMU’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy and the Tepper School of Business have joined up to develop this visionary executive education program. The program follows a team-based project/case study approach to prepare you to develop and implement a strategic digital roadmap for your home organization.

As the world becomes increasingly digitized and interconnected, there’s more reason than ever to develop yourself as a digital leader.
 Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program
As the world becomes increasingly digitized and interconnected, there’s more reason than ever to develop yourself as a digital leader.

 You’ve seen it at your own company. Everything is changing. Digitization is not slowing down and data is increasingly being used for strategic decision making across departments. Analytics and technology are becoming more important, not only in meeting the demands of your organization, but in staying agile and responsive to your customers and constituents. Carnegie Mellon's Chief Digital Officer Certificate Program provides you with the tools you need for next generation leadership in any sector. 
There’s a lot to know. From privacy and security breaches to ethics and cultural issues, there’s a lot of complexity involved in the management of digital teams, assets, communications, products, and services. Where digital transformation goes, huge benefits can follow, as can major risks.
CMU’s Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy and the Tepper School of Business have joined up to develop this visionary executive education program. The program follows a team-based project/case study approach to prepare you to develop and implement a strategic digital roadmap for your home organization.
