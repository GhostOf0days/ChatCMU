Georgia Saxelby MFA ’22 Exhibits at the Australian Embassy in Washington DC
Posted on June 27, 2019Georgia Saxelby‘s “Lullaby” will be on view at the Embassy of Australia July 10 through October 19. There will be an opening night reception on July 9 with remarks from Melissa Chui, Director of the Hirshhorn Museum & Sculpture Garden.
“Lullaby” (2017-2019) is a 2-channel video installation that explores the relationship between architecture, gender, and ritual within the monumental landscape of Washington DC. “Lullaby” documents a series of performances staged at five of the monuments on Washington’s National Mall. Collaborating with performers Viva Soudan and Bailey Nolan, Saxelby developed a series of imagined ritual gestures that repurpose the heroic forms and masculine iconography ubiquitous in the nation’s capital. In doing so, she questions the symbolic spaces in which we perform our identities and value systems today.
