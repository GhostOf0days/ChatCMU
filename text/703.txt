Doctoral Student Commencement Awards
The two Doctoral Student Commencement Awards are for doctoral students who graduated in the Summer, Fall, or Spring and who have defended by April.
A.G. Milnes Award
Awarded to a graduating ECE Ph.D. student for the Ph.D. thesis work judged to be of the highest quality and which has had, or is likely to have, significant impact in his or her field.
Dr. Arthur Milnes was the Buhl Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. He began his career as an undergraduate in London during the blitz in World War II and his career in our department in 1957 at a time when what was then called the EE Department helped us earn an international reputation in solid-state research. During his tenure at Carnegie Mellon, Professor Milnes and his students produced hundreds of papers. He also authored several books and a groundbreaking paper that was included in Citation Classics as one of the most cited items in its field. Professor Milnes received numerous awards, including the Ebers Award from the Electron Devices Society and the Van der Ziel Award for outstanding, sustained semiconductor device research.

A 1959 alumnus of Carnegie Institute of Technology, Angel Jordan has made Carnegie Mellon his life's work.  His pioneering research and technical leadership helped create one of the first university research laboratories in semiconductor devices. As an administrator, he was one of the leaders who transformed Carnegie Mellon from a local university into a prominent world-class educational and research institution.  He championed the formation of the Robotics Institute and was instrumental in attracting the Software Engineering Institute to campus.    Angel Jordan served as head of the EE Department for a decade, beginning in 1969; as dean of the College of Engineering from 1979 to 1983; and as University Provost from 1983 to 1991. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1986.
