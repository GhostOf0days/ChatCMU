The Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon administers two Ph.D. programs: the Program in Neural Computation (PNC) and the Program in Systems Neuroscience (PSN). Both programs benefit from a close relationship with the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), an integrative center spanning both Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. All PNC and PSN students are by extension members of the CNBC. We aim to take advantage of the world class strengths of CMU and Pitt, in areas including computer science, machine learning, statistics and dynamical systems and to train students to apply these tools to critical problems in neuroscience. There are also options for non-degree granting graduate study and undergraduate study.Jump to: Degree-Granting Graduate Programs, Alternate Graduate Training, Undergraduate Training, or Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.The Program in Neural Computation (PNC) is a graduate training program for students seeking advanced training in the application of quantitative approaches to the study of the brain.The Program in Systems Neuroscience (PSN) trains students with backgrounds in biology and neuroscience disciplines in the growing field of quantitative systems neuroscience and also provides them the essential background in experimental neuroscience. The CNBC Training Program is a certificate program open to students who are already pursuing doctoral degrees in a related department (listed in "Related Graduate Degree Programs" box).

What is CNBC?
The Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC) is an important training partner of the Neuroscience Institute.  The CNBC leverages the strengths of Carnegie Mellon in cognitive and computational neuroscience and those of the University of Pittsburgh in basic and clinical neuroscience to support a coordinated cross-university research and educational program of international stature. CNBC has been active for over 25 years.

 

 Degree-Granting Graduate Programs 

Program in Neural Computation (PNC)
The Program in Neural Computation (PNC) is a graduate training program for students seeking advanced training in the application of quantitative approaches to the study of the brain.
Ph.D Program in Neural Computation

Program in Systems Neuroscience (PSN)
The Program in Systems Neuroscience (PSN) trains students with backgrounds in biology and neuroscience disciplines in the growing field of quantitative systems neuroscience and also provides them the essential background in experimental neuroscience.

 Undergraduate Training 

Major in Neuroscience
The Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences and the Mellon College of Science have joined forces to establish an exciting interdisciplinary program leading to a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience.  The major includes course offerings from the departments of Psychology, Biology, and Computer Science, and the opportunity to specialize in Cognitive Neuroscience, Neurobiology, or Computational Neuroscience. All of these fields share the goal of understanding neural processes, and how these processes give rise to perception, memory, and learning.

 Academic Programs
The Neuroscience Institute at Carnegie Mellon administers two Ph.D. programs: the Program in Neural Computation (PNC) and the Program in Systems Neuroscience (PSN). Both programs benefit from a close relationship with the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), an integrative center spanning both Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. All PNC and PSN students are by extension members of the CNBC. We aim to take advantage of the world class strengths of CMU and Pitt, in areas including computer science, machine learning, statistics and dynamical systems and to train students to apply these tools to critical problems in neuroscience. There are also options for non-degree granting graduate study and undergraduate study.
