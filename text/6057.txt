 Makers, Creators, Collaborative Innovators - Learning at the Creative Intersection of Art and Technology 

IDeATe at Carnegie Mellon
IDeATe, the Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology network at Carnegie Mellon, offers undergraduate minors and courses in Game Design, Animation & Special Effects, Media Design, Sonic Arts, Design for Learning, Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Intelligent Environments, Physical Computing, Soft Technologies, and Immersive Technologies in Arts & Culture. These areas merge technology and creativity and provide learning opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. 
IDeATe minors and courses are open to all majors. We welcome students from every discipline to the unique learning environment that exists at Carnegie Mellon.

A Unique Experience
Carnegie Mellon is a special place. Highly talented faculty and undergraduate students are drawn here to study at our top-ranked departments in the College of Engineering, the College of Fine Arts, the Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences, the Mellon College of Science, the School of Computer Science, and the Tepper School of Business.
Students at Carnegie Mellon participate in IDeATe as part of their primary majors to explore how their emerging skills and expertise can interact with those of their fellow students. Through this collaborative work, they can begin to understand how their work can change and grow when they team up with an expert from a different disciplinary perspective.

In Their Own Words
IDeATe students at Carnegie Mellon are best able to articulate why this experience is important to them.

IDeATe Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology


 
Welcome! + TA Needed + Big Queer Welcome


 
First-Years 2023 Info Session
Welcome to CMU, First-Year Students!


 
Dear Bountiful Gathering + Meet Me @


 
Engaging Delights + Self-Defense VR Workshop





 Makers, Creators, Collaborative Innovators - Learning at the Creative Intersection of Art and Technology 

IDeATe at Carnegie Mellon
IDeATe, the Integrative Design, Arts, and Technology network at Carnegie Mellon, offers undergraduate minors and courses in Game Design, Animation & Special Effects, Media Design, Sonic Arts, Design for Learning, Innovation & Entrepreneurship, Intelligent Environments, Physical Computing, Soft Technologies, and Immersive Technologies in Arts & Culture. These areas merge technology and creativity and provide learning opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration. 
IDeATe minors and courses are open to all majors. We welcome students from every discipline to the unique learning environment that exists at Carnegie Mellon.

A Unique Experience
Carnegie Mellon is a special place. Highly talented faculty and undergraduate students are drawn here to study at our top-ranked departments in the College of Engineering, the College of Fine Arts, the Dietrich College of Humanities & Social Sciences, the Mellon College of Science, the School of Computer Science, and the Tepper School of Business.
Students at Carnegie Mellon participate in IDeATe as part of their primary majors to explore how their emerging skills and expertise can interact with those of their fellow students. Through this collaborative work, they can begin to understand how their work can change and grow when they team up with an expert from a different disciplinary perspective.

In Their Own Words
IDeATe students at Carnegie Mellon are best able to articulate why this experience is important to them.
