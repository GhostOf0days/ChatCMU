Senior Spotlight: Hannah Kim
Posted on April 2, 2020
Today’s Senior Spotlight focuses on Hannah Kim!
Briefly describe your artistic practice.I consider myself to be mostly a traditional animator. I am passionate about combining art and narrative to tell stories about human nature and cycles of suffering. In my works I tend to explore cycles and loops, rituals, absurd humor and tender moments.
What are you currently working on?Right now I am working mainly on my thesis animation. It tells the story of a character who is stuck in a cycle of working and surviving to care for a fruit, under constant orders of an oppressive cave which it is stuck in.
How has your artistic practice changed since you started working entirely from home?While it has been harder to feel productive, I’ve found that working from home has allowed me to really dive deep into my projects. Losing a sense of routine has caused me to work in spurts where I’m either working for hours in a row or not at all. But losing my routine has made me more excited about my work as well. It’s also allowing me to experiment with different types of art making I normally wouldn’t find time for, whether it be something serious or light and mindless.
