Carnegie Mellon University's Undergraduate Catalog is an annual publication that details academic programs and degrees offered, course descriptions, and university policies and services.
While information in this catalog is current as of August 2023, it is subject to change throughout the academic year. Students should consult with their academic department for the most up-to-date information about program requirements. Members of the campus community may direct catalog changes or inquiries to catalog@andrew.cmu.edu. Note that once the PDF of the catalog is final and archived, changes can only be made to the online version. 
The next catalog will be published in August 2024; in the interim, new courses will be displayed in the Schedule of Classes, which is published in November and April each year.
