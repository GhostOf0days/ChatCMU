Since returning from installation we spent our time building out this website / documenting our project and finishing up some of the administrative and seasonal activities at the Entertainment Technology Center.
Some of these things include;

Softs
Festival
Finals
Final Play Throughs

Softs, or Soft Opening, is a chance for the faculty to come around and give any additional feedback to project teams prior to finals so they can make last minute adjustments or iterations,
Festival, also know as BVW (Building Virtual Worlds) Festival or ETC Festival, is an annual event that the department hosts to showcase the best worlds built for the BVW course.  The event acts an an open house as well for industry professionals, alumni, and academics- so project teams also discuss their work.
We have been thrilled to showcase Tom.
Our Final presentation was a 15 minute encapsulation of the entire year we spent building Tom, focusing on the challenges of installation.
During final play throughs, faculty come through and verify our work is complete.
