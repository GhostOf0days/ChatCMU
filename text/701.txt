ECE has many student-run organizations. ECE’s bright, energetic engineering students look for endeavors that have a purpose and are organized for outcomes, including service to their members, peers and academic department. They also enjoy the social and professional development opportunities that their organizations afford. New officers are elected each academic year. These leaders organize and implement annual events and create new activities and initiatives based on member interest.

 Organizations
ECE has many student-run organizations. ECE’s bright, energetic engineering students look for endeavors that have a purpose and are organized for outcomes, including service to their members, peers and academic department. They also enjoy the social and professional development opportunities that their organizations afford. New officers are elected each academic year. These leaders organize and implement annual events and create new activities and initiatives based on member interest. ECE’s student organizations have faculty advisors and are professionally advised by the Student Organizations and Activities Advisor.

EGOEGO is a graduate-student run organization. All graduate students are members of the organization.
ECE OutreachECE Outreach aims to provide high school and middle school students with opportunities to learn about and explore engineering through short lectures and hands-on labs. The organization is run with the help of several volunteers including undergraduate and graduate students, professors, and staff at CMU.
The undergraduate and IMB Student Advisory Council (SAC) act as forums for idea generation and issue resolution aimed at maximizing the student educational experience and quality of life for the programs represented. Even though faculty and administrative offices have an open-door policy for student ideas and issues, organizing this activity and making it a proactive venture brings a sense of pride and ownership to the endeavor, resulting in continual improvement.
While each student organization has its own set of goals and objectives – as well as traditions and activities that engage and serve the entire department – the groups also work together and make up a larger student leadership corps that makes things happen in ECE each academic year.

  Organizations
ECE has many student-run organizations. ECE’s bright, energetic engineering students look for endeavors that have a purpose and are organized for outcomes, including service to their members, peers and academic department. They also enjoy the social and professional development opportunities that their organizations afford. New officers are elected each academic year. These leaders organize and implement annual events and create new activities and initiatives based on member interest. ECE’s student organizations have faculty advisors and are professionally advised by the Student Organizations and Activities Advisor.
