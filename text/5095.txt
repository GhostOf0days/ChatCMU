Practicing Art
Young artists are challenged daily in a school committed to ongoing progressive engagement with all forms of theater. The program aims to inspire students to create signature work in their chosen discipline and to celebrate unique voices from diverse cultures. The school also fosters curiosity about the fusion between other art forms and progressive theater practice, including exploring the storytelling and entertainment potential of new technologies.





Focus
The focus of the school’s undergraduate and graduate programs is to study and create theater and performance work that is constantly connected to an ever-evolving world. Theater as an art form has never been more influenced by technology, by economics and by larger cultural developments than now. As artists, School of Drama graduates must engage with compelling ideas about society, science, history, and culture from varied perspectives.
