Interdisciplinary Is in Our DNA
If all-over-the-place is your pace, then you’ll find your place at Carnegie Mellon. Our interdisciplinary culture breaks all the traditional social and academic boundaries.

Respect for Every Perspective
Diversity isn’t just a buzzword at Carnegie Mellon — it’s the very foundation of our culture. Our community members’ widely varying backgrounds, perspectives and ideas enrich every aspect of life here, from academics to social activities. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at CMU





It's a Tartan Thing
Take a walk around campus, and you’ll discover there’s nothing pedestrian about life at Carnegie Mellon.
















Undergraduate Research
The thrill of creating new knowledge — it’s at the heart of everything we do at CMU. And you can begin as early as your first year.
        
              













The Fair
Check out more than 400 student-run groups — plus Greek organizations and local arts, cultural and recreation partners — during this annual winter event.
        
              













The Fence
Got something important to say? Make a statement on the World’s Most Painted Object. Caveat: You’ll need to paint your message between midnight and sunrise. With a brush.
        
              













Makerspaces
Bring your startup ideas and projects to life. There are multiple makerspaces on campus with the coursework, training and tools you need.
        
              













Buggy
Powered by human brains and brawn alone, these feats of design and engineering hurtle along at speeds up to 40 miles per hour.
