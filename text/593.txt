Students who have deferred their enrollment for one year will need to declare their intent to enroll by submitting the decision form received with the updated admission letter they received in early April. Initial Enrollment for new graduate students begins in mid-April. New student records are created and students will activate their Andrew email account. Deferred students who plan to enroll will have their student records updated by the Registrar to reflect eligibility to enroll. The school will request I-20/DS-2019 documents for international students requiring a Certificate of Eligibility from CMU to apply for a student visa.Applicants and deferred students who have confirmed their enrollment by April 15 will have their initial enrollment processed and completed by May 1.  A delay in confirming enrollment will result in a delay in initial enrollment processing. Questions about the Initial Enrollment process should be directed to the Director of Recruitment & Enrollment. Complete: ASAP in late-April to early-MayOnce student records are created in April, new students will receive to the personal email used in their application, an email with the subject line “Action Required: Your Andrew userID Has Been Created” from it-help@cmu.edu. The email will provide instructions on how to receive your Andrew userID, set a password, and enroll in two-factor authentication (2FA) with DUO, Carnegie Mellon’s multi-factor authentication service provider. Please be sure to check your spam folder, in the event the email does not appear in your inbox. As soon as you receive the initial First Pass email, you must receive your Andrew ID, set up an initial Andrew password, and set up 2FA to activate your AndrewID and access your university email.Andrew IDs give students the ability to login to their Andrew account and access the university's computing services such as Student Information Online (SIO) and their Carnegie Mellon Google Mail account. Students will also need their Andrew ID and password to submit their health history and immunization forms, enroll in student health insurance, register for classes, and access Canvas for Orientation activities.  International students will receive important information in their university email about the completion of I-20/DS-2019.Carnegie Mellon email accounts with Google Mail are your source for official and important Carnegie Mellon communications. Please check it frequently before arriving on campus and during your academic career.  To get started with email and other computing at Carnegie Mellon, please visit the Computing Services website to explore the computing resources available to you as a Carnegie Mellon student. Complete: ASAP in late-April to early-MayNon-immigrant students will need a Certificate of Eligibility from CMU to apply for a student visa. In most cases, the Office of International Education (OIE) is responsible for generating your document. The School of Architecture will initiate the student visa process by submitting to OIE a document request for each international student by early May.Graduate students admitted for the fall semester will receive information regarding OIE's e-Form document submission process. Once the admitting department submits a request to OIE, students will receive an email with details on how to log-in to the MyOIE Portal to complete the required forms. Students will complete the information form and ask their financial sponsor (if applicable) to complete the affidavit and provide verification of available finances. These materials will be attached to the online form and submitted electronically. OIE reserves the right to request original documentation if needed. Visit the OIE website for information and frequently asked questions that address common inquiries regarding coming to Carnegie Mellon, how to apply for and receive an immigration document (I-20/DS-2019), how to apply for a visa, and arriving on campus.Beginning in early-JunePreparing to move to Pittsburgh and for your arrival to Carnegie Mellon requires advance preparation to ensure that you are ready for the Fall semester. The university and the School of Architecture have important on-boarding tasks that you will need to complete throughout the summer before you start your studies. You must regularly check your CMU email account to ensure that you receive important messages and reminders from offices like the university’s Enrollment Services (The HUB), the University Registrar’s Office, the Office of International Education (OIE), and the School of Architecture (SoA).  To assist you with your transition to graduate school, visit Carnegie Mellon’s Enrollment Services (The HUB) webpage for new incoming graduate students and the university’s Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs webpage for Graduate Student Orientation information. Reference the university’s New Graduate Student Onboarding Checklist for important information regarding required and recommended tasks to complete in the summer before you start your Carnegie Mellon University experience.Students who wish to defer their enrollment or forfeit their enrollment spot/deposit must contact the Director of Recruitment & Enrollment by email as soon as they have decided to do so and no later than the first day of fall semester classes for the enrollment change to be processed.If you have any questions as you prepare to begin your graduate studies, please refer to the School of Architecture’s FAQ webpage about Graduate Program initial enrollment and the onboarding process for new incoming graduate students.Carnegie Mellon Architecture, 5000 Forbes Avenue, College of Fine Arts 201, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 | 412.268.2354Statement of Assurance | Legal Info | Contact Us | Careers | Donate Copyright ©  Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture | All Rights ReservedGraduate Programs FolderGraduate Architecture ProgramsMaster of Advanced Architectural DesignMaster of ArchitectureM.Arch CurriculumM.Arch AwardsM.Arch Praxis IM.Arch Praxis IIMaster of Urban DesignArchitecture–Engineering–Construction ManagementMSAECMPhD-AECMBuilding Performance & DiagnosticsPhD-BPD Dissertations Computational DesignMSSDPhD in ArchitectureDoctor of DesignAMPGEMDual-Degree Options (draft)Thesis/Dissertation Submission ProceduresNew Graduate Student Initial EnrollmentIncoming Graduate Student OnboardingIncoming Graduate Students FAQGraduate Orientation Schedule Fall 2023Apr. 15  - Accept admission offer and submit enrollment depositby May 1 - Student Records created by SoA administrationApr. - May - Obtain Andrew ID and access university email accountearly-May - I-20/DS-2019 Document Request made by SoA administrationMay - Submit the New Student Initial Document Request e-Form (international students requiring a visa)Jun. 1 - New Graduate Student Initial Enrollment process completeJune - Visit SoA Incoming Graduate Student Onboarding webpage

Congratulations on accepting your offer of admission to the Graduate Program in the School of Architecture!



New Incoming Graduate Student Initial EnrollmentApplicants begin the enrollment process when they accept their offer of admission by submitting their decision form and deposit to secure their place in the Graduate Program. Review this webpage for information about initial enrollment process and procedures for new graduate students and then visit our Incoming Graduate Student Onboarding webpage outlining important tasks and deadlines in preparation for your arrival.  SoA NEW GRADUATE STUDENT INITIAL ENROLLMENT TIMELINEApr. 15  - Accept admission offer and submit enrollment depositby May 1 - Student Records created by SoA administrationApr. - May - Obtain Andrew ID and access university email accountearly-May - I-20/DS-2019 Document Request made by SoA administrationMay - Submit the New Student Initial Document Request e-Form (international students requiring a visa)Jun. 1 - New Graduate Student Initial Enrollment process completeJune - Visit SoA Incoming Graduate Student Onboarding webpage



SoA Initial Enrollment Process & ProceduresApril 15 is the enrollment decision deadline for both applicants and deferred students. Students who have deferred their enrollment for one year will need to declare their intent to enroll by submitting the decision form received with the updated admission letter they received in early April. Initial Enrollment for new graduate students begins in mid-April. New student records are created and students will activate their Andrew email account. Deferred students who plan to enroll will have their student records updated by the Registrar to reflect eligibility to enroll. The school will request I-20/DS-2019 documents for international students requiring a Certificate of Eligibility from CMU to apply for a student visa.Applicants and deferred students who have confirmed their enrollment by April 15 will have their initial enrollment processed and completed by May 1.  A delay in confirming enrollment will result in a delay in initial enrollment processing. Questions about the Initial Enrollment process should be directed to the Director of Recruitment & Enrollment. 

  

OBTAIN ANDREW ID AND ACCESS UNIVERSITY EMAILComplete: ASAP in late-April to early-MayOnce student records are created in April, new students will receive to the personal email used in their application, an email with the subject line “Action Required: Your Andrew userID Has Been Created” from it-help@cmu.edu. The email will provide instructions on how to receive your Andrew userID, set a password, and enroll in two-factor authentication (2FA) with DUO, Carnegie Mellon’s multi-factor authentication service provider. Please be sure to check your spam folder, in the event the email does not appear in your inbox. As soon as you receive the initial First Pass email, you must receive your Andrew ID, set up an initial Andrew password, and set up 2FA to activate your AndrewID and access your university email.Andrew IDs give students the ability to login to their Andrew account and access the university's computing services such as Student Information Online (SIO) and their Carnegie Mellon Google Mail account. Students will also need their Andrew ID and password to submit their health history and immunization forms, enroll in student health insurance, register for classes, and access Canvas for Orientation activities.  International students will receive important information in their university email about the completion of I-20/DS-2019.Carnegie Mellon email accounts with Google Mail are your source for official and important Carnegie Mellon communications. Please check it frequently before arriving on campus and during your academic career.  To get started with email and other computing at Carnegie Mellon, please visit the Computing Services website to explore the computing resources available to you as a Carnegie Mellon student. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS - NON-IMMIGRANT DOCUMENT REQUESTSComplete: ASAP in late-April to early-MayNon-immigrant students will need a Certificate of Eligibility from CMU to apply for a student visa. In most cases, the Office of International Education (OIE) is responsible for generating your document. The School of Architecture will initiate the student visa process by submitting to OIE a document request for each international student by early May.Graduate students admitted for the fall semester will receive information regarding OIE's e-Form document submission process. Once the admitting department submits a request to OIE, students will receive an email with details on how to log-in to the MyOIE Portal to complete the required forms. Students will complete the information form and ask their financial sponsor (if applicable) to complete the affidavit and provide verification of available finances. These materials will be attached to the online form and submitted electronically. OIE reserves the right to request original documentation if needed. Visit the OIE website for information and frequently asked questions that address common inquiries regarding coming to Carnegie Mellon, how to apply for and receive an immigration document (I-20/DS-2019), how to apply for a visa, and arriving on campus.NEW GRADUATE STUDENT ONBOARDINGBeginning in early-JunePreparing to move to Pittsburgh and for your arrival to Carnegie Mellon requires advance preparation to ensure that you are ready for the Fall semester. The university and the School of Architecture have important on-boarding tasks that you will need to complete throughout the summer before you start your studies. You must regularly check your CMU email account to ensure that you receive important messages and reminders from offices like the university’s Enrollment Services (The HUB), the University Registrar’s Office, the Office of International Education (OIE), and the School of Architecture (SoA).  To assist you with your transition to graduate school, visit Carnegie Mellon’s Enrollment Services (The HUB) webpage for new incoming graduate students and the university’s Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs webpage for Graduate Student Orientation information. Reference the university’s New Graduate Student Onboarding Checklist for important information regarding required and recommended tasks to complete in the summer before you start your Carnegie Mellon University experience.

Review this webpage for information about initial enrollment process and procedures for new graduate students and then visit our Incoming Graduate Student Onboarding webpage outlining important tasks and deadlines in preparation for your arrival.  SoA NEW GRADUATE STUDENT INITIAL ENROLLMENT TIMELINEApr. 15  - Accept admission offer and submit enrollment depositby May 1 - Student Records created by SoA administrationApr. - May - Obtain Andrew ID and access university email accountearly-May - I-20/DS-2019 Document Request made by SoA administrationMay - Submit the New Student Initial Document Request e-Form (international students requiring a visa)Jun. 1 - New Graduate Student Initial Enrollment process completeJune - Visit SoA Incoming Graduate Student Onboarding webpage



SoA Initial Enrollment Process & ProceduresApril 15 is the enrollment decision deadline for both applicants and deferred students. Students who have deferred their enrollment for one year will need to declare their intent to enroll by submitting the decision form received with the updated admission letter they received in early April. Initial Enrollment for new graduate students begins in mid-April. New student records are created and students will activate their Andrew email account. Deferred students who plan to enroll will have their student records updated by the Registrar to reflect eligibility to enroll. The school will request I-20/DS-2019 documents for international students requiring a Certificate of Eligibility from CMU to apply for a student visa.Applicants and deferred students who have confirmed their enrollment by April 15 will have their initial enrollment processed and completed by May 1.  A delay in confirming enrollment will result in a delay in initial enrollment processing. Questions about the Initial Enrollment process should be directed to the Director of Recruitment & Enrollment. 

  

OBTAIN ANDREW ID AND ACCESS UNIVERSITY EMAILComplete: ASAP in late-April to early-MayOnce student records are created in April, new students will receive to the personal email used in their application, an email with the subject line “Action Required: Your Andrew userID Has Been Created” from it-help@cmu.edu. The email will provide instructions on how to receive your Andrew userID, set a password, and enroll in two-factor authentication (2FA) with DUO, Carnegie Mellon’s multi-factor authentication service provider. Please be sure to check your spam folder, in the event the email does not appear in your inbox. As soon as you receive the initial First Pass email, you must receive your Andrew ID, set up an initial Andrew password, and set up 2FA to activate your AndrewID and access your university email.Andrew IDs give students the ability to login to their Andrew account and access the university's computing services such as Student Information Online (SIO) and their Carnegie Mellon Google Mail account. Students will also need their Andrew ID and password to submit their health history and immunization forms, enroll in student health insurance, register for classes, and access Canvas for Orientation activities.  International students will receive important information in their university email about the completion of I-20/DS-2019.Carnegie Mellon email accounts with Google Mail are your source for official and important Carnegie Mellon communications. Please check it frequently before arriving on campus and during your academic career.  To get started with email and other computing at Carnegie Mellon, please visit the Computing Services website to explore the computing resources available to you as a Carnegie Mellon student. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS - NON-IMMIGRANT DOCUMENT REQUESTSComplete: ASAP in late-April to early-MayNon-immigrant students will need a Certificate of Eligibility from CMU to apply for a student visa. In most cases, the Office of International Education (OIE) is responsible for generating your document. The School of Architecture will initiate the student visa process by submitting to OIE a document request for each international student by early May.Graduate students admitted for the fall semester will receive information regarding OIE's e-Form document submission process. Once the admitting department submits a request to OIE, students will receive an email with details on how to log-in to the MyOIE Portal to complete the required forms. Students will complete the information form and ask their financial sponsor (if applicable) to complete the affidavit and provide verification of available finances. These materials will be attached to the online form and submitted electronically. OIE reserves the right to request original documentation if needed.
