Graduate Conference FundingGraduate Student Conference Funding is provided by the Graduate Student Assembly and the Provost’s Office, and is managed by the Office of the Assistant Vice Provost for Graduate Education. The goal of the funding is to enable more Carnegie Mellon graduate students to make presentations at key conferences and exhibitions in their fields or attend conferences and learn about the broader field of study to which they belong. This funding opportunity is available to individual graduate students, a group of graduate students attending the same conference and/or a group of members from a registered club/organization attending the same conference. If you have submitted an abstract to present at a conference, you do not have to wait until it is accepted to apply.
This award amount is $500 per student with a maximum amount of $1,000 per group. Awardees are selected through a lottery process on a quarterly basis. This is considered a partial source of support and applicants are required to seek funds from the following other sources first, before applying for these funds, including: Funds from the conferences they will be attending; their own advisor; their department; their college. A letter from the applicant’s advisor is required. Information and details about the application process can be found here.

Graduate students will only be awarded research funds once per academic year, and the Head of School will determine the availability of funds. Funds will not be awarded for the production or fabrication of work or travel to see exhibitions or performances. The funds are awarded by the MFA Program Director through direct application. Application for funds should be submitted via email to the Program Director and Coordinator and include a paragraph outlining the intended research and its relevance to the student’s practice, a timeline for the use of the funds, and a budget that includes any other funding the student is using for the travel/research. Students receiving travel- related research funds will be required to write a summary of their research trip for the On The Ground student dispatch series published on the school’s website and in the weekly electronic newsletter. On the Ground dispatches should be between 500- 750 words and include 2-3 images from travel. They are due to the Program Director and Program Coordinator within 30 days of return from travel; failure to deliver a dispatch in a timely manner will result in a student being prohibited from receiving graduate studio research funding for the subsequent academic year. An example On The Ground can be read here.
