Posted on September 28, 2020Around Beaver
County, alumna Elizabeth “Betty” Asche Douglas (BFA ’51) is warmly referred to
as the “First Lady of the Arts” for her lifelong devotion to the arts in her
community and beyond. An accomplished visual artist and jazz vocalist, Douglas’
art career began when she enrolled as the first Black student in the Art
Department at Carnegie Mellon University, then known as the Carnegie Institute
of Technology. At 16 years old, she was also the youngest.Though neither of
her parents had a high school education, both had a love of learning and an
appreciation for the arts. “Things done in an artful fashion were part of my
family’s lifestyle,” she said. Her mother, the foster daughter of a Baptist
preacher, learned to play the piano as a child, and they used to jokingly call
her father “the best Black Irish tenor in the world.” Douglas also fondly
remembers her father returning home from work in the evening and sitting down
to draw.In third grade, Douglas
won an art award—the first of many to follow—for a book poster contest sponsored
by the Carnegie Library.With varied
interests and scholastic achievement in everything she studied, she received
several scholarship offers from many universities in diverse fields, but
decided to attend Carnegie Tech because it was the best scholarship and closest
to home.She only learned
later in life that she was the first Black student to attend Carnegie Tech in
the Department of Painting and Design. About fifteen years earlier, Elizabeth
Catlett, who would go on to become an internationally-acclaimed sculptor, was
denied entry to Carnegie Tech—despite having won a scholarship—after the
university found out she was Black. (CMU presented Catlett with an honorary
doctorate of fine arts in 2008.)At Carnegie Tech, Douglas
continued to pursue multidisciplinary interests, performing in Scotch &
Soda musicals, serving as the secretary of the Beaux-Arts Society, and president
of the Mortar Board, the women’s honor society. One of her fondest memories is
of “Happenings,” held on the weekends in the College of Fine Arts, where
students and faculty sang, danced, and performed parody skits and stand-up
comedy.Douglas was two
years behind Andy Warhol, or Andy Warhola as he was known then. “I was in the
same little gang of outsiders mentored by a couple of the youngest faculty members
that he belonged to,” she recalled.After receiving her
degree, Douglas went downtown to get a job in the advertising or display
department of one of the big department stores, which was a typical career path
for many students who graduated with an art degree from Carnegie Tech, she
said. With a distinguished mark on her graduating portfolio, she thought she
would surely be hired, but instead she was told her portfolio did not meet
department stores’ standards.Some of her white
classmates were shocked to hear this, given the quality of her work. “One of my
best friends said, ‘Let me take your portfolio,’ and went downtown with my
portfolio in her arm and was offered the job,” Douglas recalled.After that
experience, she got a job at a local Westinghouse factory in order to save up
enough money to attend graduate school at the University of Pittsburgh.Both while at Pitt
and Carnegie Tech, Douglas was part of a group of collegians, some of whom were
military veterans, that began to challenge segregationist policies in
Pittsburgh. At the time, social clubs along Forbes Avenue denied entry to Black
people, and Douglas recalls calling Pitt “the cathedral of ignorance” for turning
a blind eye to these social issues.Douglas said that at
the time, “diplomats from around the world were coming to places like
Pittsburgh, drawing our attention to the fact that if we were of darker
complexion, then we were not allowed to go to many of the same places and do
many of the same things that other people were. At first, African diplomats
were not received with the same open-arm welcoming character that they would be
today.”While policies were
shifted to allow African diplomats to attend white-only places, the same rights
were not extended to the city’s Black population. One of the memories that
sticks out most vividly is when Douglas’ friends dressed up as African
diplomats and went to Webster Hall to draw attention to this injustice.After finishing her
graduate degree, a local minister suggested she look at Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs) in the South for teaching jobs, and she landed her
first gig filling in for a professor on sabbatical at Southern University in
Baton Rouge. There, she became friends with Reverend T. J. Jemison, who helped
organize the nation’s first successful bus boycott. She met Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. when he came to Baton Rouge to speak with Rev. Jemison about the
boycott, which served as a model for the much more well-known bus boycott in
Montgomery.After Southern
University, she took several other temporary positions at other HBCUs before
meeting her husband while teaching at Texas College in Tyler, TX. They got
married and moved to Fort Worth, and, finding herself in need of a job, Douglas
went to the offices of Sepia
magazine, a photojournalistic magazine similar to Life or Ebony, where she
was hired to help with magazine layout.Quickly rising through
the ranks, she became an editor for Jonathan Howard Griffin’s series of
articles that would be turned into the book Black
Like Me, an account of racial segregation in the Jim Crow South and a key
text of the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s.In the 1960s, Douglas
returned to Beaver County, where she became a professor at Geneva College and
helped to develop the Interdisciplinary Humanities program, which just
celebrated its 50th anniversary. Douglas said the program was inspired by a
course she took at Carnegie Tech, The Arts and Civilization, which was required
for all students. “It was a group-taught course that had historians, and
art, and literature, and music historians, and we went through the whole of
civilization noting how arts and technology brought civilization forward,” she
said.During this
time, she also raised three daughters. “One of the things that I am
proudest of having accomplished is having three beautiful, intelligent, and
professionally-respected daughters,” she said.Douglas retired
in the late 1990s when her husband became terminally ill, though she still
regularly gives guest lectures and performances at Geneva College.Today, you can
find her art at the Douglas Art Gallery in Rochester, PA, which she established
with her husband, and in exhibitions around the region and beyond. She
currently has work in the “Mister Fred Rogers Fine Arts Juried Exhibition” at
the Latrobe Art Center and in “Women of Visions” at the Pittsburgh Center for
Arts and Media. Though COVID-19 restrictions have limited some of her performance
engagements, she has sung and displayed some of her visual art recently as part
of the Bloomfield Garden Club series and at Con Alma in Shadyside.Over her long
career, she has won awards from numerous juried competitions, and her
professional career is archived in the National Museum of Women in the Arts.
She currently serves on the boards of directors for several community
organizations, including the Merrick Art Gallery Associates, the Lincoln Park
Performing Arts Charter School, the Guild Council of the Pittsburgh Center for
the Arts, the Midland Arts Council, and the Advisory Board of Sweetwater Center
for the Arts in Sewickley.Douglas
describes her art as “expressing various levels and elements of being
alive” and sees art as integral to shaping a better future.“I like to encourage young people to discover who they are
and what abilities they have that can make a worthwhile contribution to the
community,” she said. “Understand that the world that we find is not the world
that we must accept or maintain. Instead, always look for what could be better,
what could be improved, what could be made more beautiful, what could we take
better care of.”Copyright © 2023 School of Art | Carnegie Mellon University. All Rights Reserved. Statement of Assurance.

were not received with the same open-arm welcoming character that they would be
today.”
While policies were
shifted to allow African diplomats to attend white-only places, the same rights
were not extended to the city’s Black population. One of the memories that
sticks out most vividly is when Douglas’ friends dressed up as African
diplomats and went to Webster Hall to draw attention to this injustice.
After finishing her
graduate degree, a local minister suggested she look at Historically Black Colleges
and Universities (HBCUs) in the South for teaching jobs, and she landed her
first gig filling in for a professor on sabbatical at Southern University in
Baton Rouge. There, she became friends with Reverend T. J. Jemison, who helped
organize the nation’s first successful bus boycott. She met Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. when he came to Baton Rouge to speak with Rev. Jemison about the
boycott, which served as a model for the much more well-known bus boycott in
Montgomery.
After Southern
University, she took several other temporary positions at other HBCUs before
meeting her husband while teaching at Texas College in Tyler, TX. They got
married and moved to Fort Worth, and, finding herself in need of a job, Douglas
went to the offices of Sepia
magazine, a photojournalistic magazine similar to Life or Ebony, where she
was hired to help with magazine layout.
Quickly rising through
the ranks, she became an editor for Jonathan Howard Griffin’s series of
articles that would be turned into the book Black
Like Me, an account of racial segregation in the Jim Crow South and a key
text of the Civil Rights movements of the 1960s.
“Water and Spirit,” inspired by Bach’s “Fugue in G Minor” and “Guardian,” created for solo exhibition of sculpture assemblages at the Hoyt Art Center
In the 1960s, Douglas
returned to Beaver County, where she became a professor at Geneva College and
helped to develop the Interdisciplinary Humanities program, which just
celebrated its 50th anniversary. Douglas said the program was inspired by a
course she took at Carnegie Tech, The Arts and Civilization, which was required
for all students. “It was a group-taught course that had historians, and
art, and literature, and music historians, and we went through the whole of
civilization noting how arts and technology brought civilization forward,” she
said.
During this
time, she also raised three daughters. “One of the things that I am
proudest of having accomplished is having three beautiful, intelligent, and
professionally-respected daughters,” she said.
Douglas retired
in the late 1990s when her husband became terminally ill, though she still
regularly gives guest lectures and performances at Geneva College.
Today, you can
find her art at the Douglas Art Gallery in Rochester, PA, which she established
with her husband, and in exhibitions around the region and beyond. She
currently has work in the “Mister Fred Rogers Fine Arts Juried Exhibition” at
the Latrobe Art Center and in “Women of Visions” at the Pittsburgh Center for
Arts and Media. Though COVID-19 restrictions have limited some of her performance
engagements, she has sung and displayed some of her visual art recently as part
of the Bloomfield Garden Club series and at Con Alma in Shadyside.
Over her long
career, she has won awards from numerous juried competitions, and her
professional career is archived in the National Museum of Women in the Arts.
She currently serves on the boards of directors for several community
organizations, including the Merrick Art Gallery Associates, the Lincoln Park
Performing Arts Charter School, the Guild Council of the Pittsburgh Center for
the Arts, the Midland Arts Council, and the Advisory Board of Sweetwater Center
for the Arts in Sewickley.
Douglas
describes her art as “expressing various levels and elements of being
alive” and sees art as integral to shaping a better future.
“I like to encourage young people to discover who they are
and what abilities they have that can make a worthwhile contribution to the
community,” she said. “Understand that the world that we find is not the world
that we must accept or maintain. Instead, always look for what could be better,
what could be improved, what could be made more beautiful, what could we take
better care of.”

Meet Alumna Elizabeth “Betty” Asche Douglas, CMU Art’s First Black Student
Posted on September 28, 2020
Around Beaver
County, alumna Elizabeth “Betty” Asche Douglas (BFA ’51) is warmly referred to
as the “First Lady of the Arts” for her lifelong devotion to the arts in her
community and beyond. An accomplished visual artist and jazz vocalist, Douglas’
art career began when she enrolled as the first Black student in the Art
Department at Carnegie Mellon University, then known as the Carnegie Institute
of Technology. At 16 years old, she was also the youngest.
Though neither of
her parents had a high school education, both had a love of learning and an
appreciation for the arts. “Things done in an artful fashion were part of my
family’s lifestyle,” she said. Her mother, the foster daughter of a Baptist
preacher, learned to play the piano as a child, and they used to jokingly call
her father “the best Black Irish tenor in the world.” Douglas also fondly
remembers her father returning home from work in the evening and sitting down
to draw.
In third grade, Douglas
won an art award—the first of many to follow—for a book poster contest sponsored
by the Carnegie Library.
With varied
interests and scholastic achievement in everything she studied, she received
several scholarship offers from many universities in diverse fields, but
decided to attend Carnegie Tech because it was the best scholarship and closest
to home.
She only learned
later in life that she was the first Black student to attend Carnegie Tech in
the Department of Painting and Design. About fifteen years earlier, Elizabeth
Catlett, who would go on to become an internationally-acclaimed sculptor, was
denied entry to Carnegie Tech—despite having won a scholarship—after the
university found out she was Black. (CMU presented Catlett with an honorary
doctorate of fine arts in 2008.)
At Carnegie Tech, Douglas
continued to pursue multidisciplinary interests, performing in Scotch &
Soda musicals, serving as the secretary of the Beaux-Arts Society, and president
of the Mortar Board, the women’s honor society. One of her fondest memories is
of “Happenings,” held on the weekends in the College of Fine Arts, where
students and faculty sang, danced, and performed parody skits and stand-up
comedy.
Douglas was two
years behind Andy Warhol, or Andy Warhola as he was known then. “I was in the
same little gang of outsiders mentored by a couple of the youngest faculty members
that he belonged to,” she recalled.
“Bridge of Sighs” and “Freedom Dance,” part of a suite of 16 works Douglas created for an installation based on August Wilson’s play Jitney
After receiving her
degree, Douglas went downtown to get a job in the advertising or display
department of one of the big department stores, which was a typical career path
for many students who graduated with an art degree from Carnegie Tech, she
said. With a distinguished mark on her graduating portfolio, she thought she
would surely be hired, but instead she was told her portfolio did not meet
department stores’ standards.
Some of her white
classmates were shocked to hear this, given the quality of her work. “One of my
best friends said, ‘Let me take your portfolio,’ and went downtown with my
portfolio in her arm and was offered the job,” Douglas recalled.
After that
experience, she got a job at a local Westinghouse factory in order to save up
enough money to attend graduate school at the University of Pittsburgh.
Both while at Pitt
and Carnegie Tech, Douglas was part of a group of collegians, some of whom were
military veterans, that began to challenge segregationist policies in
Pittsburgh. At the time, social clubs along Forbes Avenue denied entry to Black
people, and Douglas recalls calling Pitt “the cathedral of ignorance” for turning
a blind eye to these social issues.
Douglas said that at
the time, “diplomats from around the world were coming to places like
Pittsburgh, drawing our attention to the fact that if we were of darker
complexion, then we were not allowed to go to many of the same places and do
many of the same things that other people were. At first, African diplomats
were not received with the same open-arm welcoming character that they would be
today.”
While policies were
shifted to allow African diplomats to attend white-only places, the same rights
were not extended to the city’s Black population. One of the memories that
