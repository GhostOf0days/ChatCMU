Arscott is a British architect who has been involved in design centered practice and radical construction initiatives since qualifying in the 1970's. After completing her diploma at the Architectural Association in London she studied carpentry, joinery and wood machining. She worked for ten years as a carpenter/cabinet maker and educator, with 5 others built and designed a cooperative house and initiated two EU funded training schemes in London to encourage women to enter the building industry. Arscott returned to architectural practice in 1986, first to Casson Conder to work on the extension to Parliament buildings in London, then to the cooperative practice of Edward Cullinan Architects where she became a director and worked on a series of arts and educational buildings. In 1996 she was a founding architect in Knox Bhavan Architects where for ten years she worked on a wide range of historic buildings and residential projects. A recent project, Holly Barn in Norfolk, won a number of prestigious awards including the RIBA Manser Medal 2006. Over the years Arscott has been interested in the detailing and realization of art ideas and has she has assisted various artists with gallery exhibitions and with public art installations. Her architectural work ranges across public and private sectors and combines elegance with economical use of materials. The projects reflect careful attention to the needs of client and user whilst involving the creative contribution of the builder.Carnegie Mellon Architecture, 5000 Forbes Avenue, College of Fine Arts 201, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 | 412.268.2354Statement of Assurance | Legal Info | Contact Us | Careers | Donate Copyright ©  Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture | All Rights ReservedFaculty & Staff FolderFaculty & Staff (new design)Faculty & StaffJared AbrahamVicki AchnaniSarosh AnklesariaRobert J.

Mary-Lou ArscottCFA 206B | 412.268.1709mlarscott@cmu.edu



Mary-Lou ArscottRIBAStudio ProfessorASSOCIATE HEAD for DEsign FUndamentalsMary-Lou Arscott is Studio Professor at the School of Architecture. She was named Associate Head for Design Fundamentals at the school in 2021. Arscott is a British architect who has been involved in design centered practice and radical construction initiatives since qualifying in the 1970's. After completing her diploma at the Architectural Association in London she studied carpentry, joinery and wood machining. She worked for ten years as a carpenter/cabinet maker and educator, with 5 others built and designed a cooperative house and initiated two EU funded training schemes in London to encourage women to enter the building industry. Arscott returned to architectural practice in 1986, first to Casson Conder to work on the extension to Parliament buildings in London, then to the cooperative practice of Edward Cullinan Architects where she became a director and worked on a series of arts and educational buildings. In 1996 she was a founding architect in Knox Bhavan Architects where for ten years she worked on a wide range of historic buildings and residential projects. A recent project, Holly Barn in Norfolk, won a number of prestigious awards including the RIBA Manser Medal 2006. Over the years Arscott has been interested in the detailing and realization of art ideas and has she has assisted various artists with gallery exhibitions and with public art installations. Her architectural work ranges across public and private sectors and combines elegance with economical use of materials. The projects reflect careful attention to the needs of client and user whilst involving the creative contribution of the builder.
