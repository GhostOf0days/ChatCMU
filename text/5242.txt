Week 8 Summary 



This week, we made 3D art assets for rainforest organism and combined block demo, virtual table, and assets. Based on the ArUco markers, we succeed on our networking using our own platform. We also playtested 3D line demo to elementary students and ETC visitors. 



Organism Stacking 




 




We first started with simple macaw model stacking and developed it into multiple organisms stacking. 




 




Virtual Table Final Touch 



This is final version of how virtual table interaction looks like. 




 




Networking 



Using ArUco markers on the table, rather than the big markers on the wall, we manage to pull off our first networking prototype, which is passing the geometry back and forth. We decided to use markers on the table because fully mapping the room was much difficult than mapping the table and use that position to calculate other’s position.

Week 8 Summary 



This week, we made 3D art assets for rainforest organism and combined block demo, virtual table, and assets. Based on the ArUco markers, we succeed on our networking using our own platform. We also playtested 3D line demo to elementary students and ETC visitors. 



Organism Stacking 




 




We first started with simple macaw model stacking and developed it into multiple organisms stacking. 




 




Virtual Table Final Touch 



This is final version of how virtual table interaction looks like. 




 




Networking 



Using ArUco markers on the table, rather than the big markers on the wall, we manage to pull off our first networking prototype, which is passing the geometry back and forth. We decided to use markers on the table because fully mapping the room was much difficult than mapping the table and use that position to calculate other’s position.
