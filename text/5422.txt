Giving is personal, and at the Tepper School, we provide our alumni, friends, faculty, staff, and students with the means to be philanthropic and effectual in ways that reflect their interests, lifestyle and financial situation.There are various opportunities to support the school and affect change. Loyalty, leadership, and legacy serve as the three pillars that capture these opportunities and allow you to impact real programs, real outcomes, and real lives.Loyalty: We value our loyal supporters who participate in annual giving each year. Annual investments demonstrate your belief in our brand of education and form the backbone of the school. Consistency, not dollar amount, is the base of this pillar.Leadership: Contributions at the W.L. Mellon Society level ($2,500+) provide a catalyst for you to greatly impact the school. Specifically, major gifts at the $50,000+ level are used to endow scholarships and fellowships to attract the most exceptional students, create professorships to retain top faculty, and enhance the overall Tepper School experience for all stakeholders. Contact us to begin planning your leadership gift today.Legacy: Leave a lasting impact on the Tepper School by making a planned gift. Carnegie Mellon University provides many ways to support your estate planning and financial needs. Planned gifts ensure the success of the school well into the future.Explore Giving OpportunitiesReach out if you have questions about our fundraising priorities, your giving history, or how to contribute.

Give to the Tepper School
Giving is personal, and at the Tepper School, we provide our alumni, friends, faculty, staff, and students with the means to be philanthropic and effectual in ways that reflect their interests, lifestyle and financial situation.
Philanthropy for a Lifetime
There are various opportunities to support the school and affect change. Loyalty, leadership, and legacy serve as the three pillars that capture these opportunities and allow you to impact real programs, real outcomes, and real lives.
Loyalty: We value our loyal supporters who participate in annual giving each year. Annual investments demonstrate your belief in our brand of education and form the backbone of the school. Consistency, not dollar amount, is the base of this pillar.
Leadership: Contributions at the W.L. Mellon Society level ($2,500+) provide a catalyst for you to greatly impact the school. Specifically, major gifts at the $50,000+ level are used to endow scholarships and fellowships to attract the most exceptional students, create professorships to retain top faculty, and enhance the overall Tepper School experience for all stakeholders. Contact us to begin planning your leadership gift today.
Legacy: Leave a lasting impact on the Tepper School by making a planned gift. Carnegie Mellon University provides many ways to support your estate planning and financial needs. Planned gifts ensure the success of the school well into the future.

Give to the Tepper School
Giving is personal, and at the Tepper School, we provide our alumni, friends, faculty, staff, and students with the means to be philanthropic and effectual in ways that reflect their interests, lifestyle and financial situation.
Philanthropy for a Lifetime
There are various opportunities to support the school and affect change. Loyalty, leadership, and legacy serve as the three pillars that capture these opportunities and allow you to impact real programs, real outcomes, and real lives.
Loyalty: We value our loyal supporters who participate in annual giving each year. Annual investments demonstrate your belief in our brand of education and form the backbone of the school. Consistency, not dollar amount, is the base of this pillar.
Leadership: Contributions at the W.L. Mellon Society level ($2,500+) provide a catalyst for you to greatly impact the school. Specifically, major gifts at the $50,000+ level are used to endow scholarships and fellowships to attract the most exceptional students, create professorships to retain top faculty, and enhance the overall Tepper School experience for all stakeholders. Contact us to begin planning your leadership gift today.
Legacy: Leave a lasting impact on the Tepper School by making a planned gift. Carnegie Mellon University provides many ways to support your estate planning and financial needs. Planned gifts ensure the success of the school well into the future.

Give to the Tepper School
Giving is personal, and at the Tepper School, we provide our alumni, friends, faculty, staff, and students with the means to be philanthropic and effectual in ways that reflect their interests, lifestyle and financial situation.
Philanthropy for a Lifetime
There are various opportunities to support the school and affect change. Loyalty, leadership, and legacy serve as the three pillars that capture these opportunities and allow you to impact real programs, real outcomes, and real lives.
Loyalty: We value our loyal supporters who participate in annual giving each year. Annual investments demonstrate your belief in our brand of education and form the backbone of the school. Consistency, not dollar amount, is the base of this pillar.
Leadership: Contributions at the W.L. Mellon Society level ($2,500+) provide a catalyst for you to greatly impact the school. Specifically, major gifts at the $50,000+ level are used to endow scholarships and fellowships to attract the most exceptional students, create professorships to retain top faculty, and enhance the overall Tepper School experience for all stakeholders. Contact us to begin planning your leadership gift today.
Legacy: Leave a lasting impact on the Tepper School by making a planned gift. Carnegie Mellon University provides many ways to support your estate planning and financial needs. Planned gifts ensure the success of the school well into the future.
