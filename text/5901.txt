Rosabel Rosalind MFA ’23 Exhibits at Bunker Projects
Posted on January 23, 2023
Rosabel Rosalind‘s work is included in “Hot House,” on view at Bunker Projects in Pittsburgh January 6 through February 3. The exhibition is curated by Eva Conrad.
“Hot House” brings together a diverse group of artists whose work is part of the current resurgence of the pattern and decoration movement in response to the white washing minimalism of gentrification aesthetics. Instead, maximalism and vibrant color provide an aesthetic of optimism that gestures back to traditionally more democratic forms of folk art and craft.
