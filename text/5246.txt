Week 12 Summary 



We are now starting to develop collaboration prototype using chemistry as a content. We divided our programming tasks to two major parts: networking and interaction. 



Classroom Networking 



We are using markers to anchor guests in the virtual world. Currently we are using ArUco markers to position guests properly. 




 




We are exploring various ways to enter the virtual classroom. First, our initial thought is to push the join button to connect to our virtual classroom. 




 




If time meets, we also want to explore using ArUco marker cube to enhance the learning experience. 




 




Chemistry Interaction 



After deciding chemistry as a high-level content, we focused on designing molecular bond mechanic.This is our early stage bonding. 




 




This is more refined version of atom bonding.
