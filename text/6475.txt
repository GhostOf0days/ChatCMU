Sobia Ahmad MFA ’24 Wins Juror’s Award from Museum of Craft and Design, San Francisco
Posted on August 18, 2021
Sobia Ahmad MFA ’24 won the second place Juror’s Award for her work in the virtual exhibition “Call & Response: Craft as a Tool for Activism” organized by the Museum of Craft and Design in San Franciso. Made in collaboration with her grandmother, Ahmad’s work “Wherever you are is called Here” reimagines the symbolism of flags and its relationship to place and home for immigrant, displaced, and exiled communities.
“Craftivism” (as coined by Betsy Greer in her 2011 essay “Craftivist History” in Extra/Ordinary: Craft and Contemporary Art) celebrates the power of craft to bring about political change. “Call & Response,” juried by Glenn Adamson, Ebitenyefa Baralaye, and Nate Watson, intends to highlight artists that are working at this crucial intersection of craft and activism, uplifting their political ideals and their communities through their medium of choice.
