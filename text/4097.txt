CMU Team Wins $1M XPRIZE Digital Learning ChallengeCarnegie Mellon University learning science researchers John Stamper, Norman Bier and Steven Moore are part of a team that won first place in the XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge, a competition to find and improve the most effective learning tools.The Myth of the Fast LearnerLearning science experts from Carnegie Mellon University's Human Computer Interaction Institute found that, in the right conditions, people learn at a remarkably similar rate. Ken Koedinger, the Hillman Professor of Computer Science, led the research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Kumar Garg on the Future of Learning EngineeringKumar Garg from Schmidt Futures will present his 2022 Simon Initiative Distinguished Lecture, "Shaping the Field of Learning Engineering," at an in-person-only event at 5 p.m. on Nov. 7, 2022 in Carnegie Mellon University's Rangos Ballroom. In this Q&A, Garg explained why the field of learning engineering is at a crucial juncture. HCII Researchers Awarded $2M Grant To Test AI-Based Mobile Tutoring SoftwareCarnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute will use a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences to develop and test a smartphone-based tutoring system for middle school mathematics that's rooted in artificial intelligence.AI-Powered Museum Exhibit Shows Technology's Potential in Education NoRILLA, a project from the School of Computer Science's Human-Computer Interaction Institute that uses artificial intelligence to assist children in hands-on educational experiments is one of six AI-focused projects selected for an exhibit at CaixaForum Valencia, a new museum in Valencia, Spain.CMU Team Advances to Final Round of $1M XPRIZE CompetitionJohn Stamper, Norman Bier and Steven Moore are part of a multi-university team that has advanced to the final round of the XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge. The team has created a tool, Experiments as a Service Infrastructure (EASI), that educators can use to conduct experiments in the classroom.The Future of Classroom ExperimentationCMU and its partners were recently awarded a nearly $3 million National Science Foundation grant to fund a new framework for adaptive experimentation in classrooms and digital learning spaces. John Stamper answers questions about what his team of multidisciplinary researchers hopes to achieve. Named for the late Nobel and Turing Award laureate Herbert Simon, this initiative harnesses a cross-disciplinary, learning-engineering ecosystem that has developed over several decades at CMU with the goal of measurably improving student learning outcomes. Learn more.Explore the free toolkit

 CMU Team Wins $1M XPRIZE Digital Learning ChallengeCarnegie Mellon University learning science researchers John Stamper, Norman Bier and Steven Moore are part of a team that won first place in the XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge, a competition to find and improve the most effective learning tools.

The Myth of the Fast LearnerLearning science experts from Carnegie Mellon University's Human Computer Interaction Institute found that, in the right conditions, people learn at a remarkably similar rate. Ken Koedinger, the Hillman Professor of Computer Science, led the research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Kumar Garg on the Future of Learning EngineeringKumar Garg from Schmidt Futures will present his 2022 Simon Initiative Distinguished Lecture, "Shaping the Field of Learning Engineering," at an in-person-only event at 5 p.m. on Nov. 7, 2022 in Carnegie Mellon University's Rangos Ballroom. In this Q&A, Garg explained why the field of learning engineering is at a crucial juncture. 

HCII Researchers Awarded $2M Grant To Test AI-Based Mobile Tutoring SoftwareCarnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute will use a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences to develop and test a smartphone-based tutoring system for middle school mathematics that's rooted in artificial intelligence.

AI-Powered Museum Exhibit Shows Technology's Potential in Education NoRILLA, a project from the School of Computer Science's Human-Computer Interaction Institute that uses artificial intelligence to assist children in hands-on educational experiments is one of six AI-focused projects selected for an exhibit at CaixaForum Valencia, a new museum in Valencia, Spain.

CMU Team Advances to Final Round of $1M XPRIZE CompetitionJohn Stamper, Norman Bier and Steven Moore are part of a multi-university team that has advanced to the final round of the XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge. The team has created a tool, Experiments as a Service Infrastructure (EASI), that educators can use to conduct experiments in the classroom.

The Future of Classroom ExperimentationCMU and its partners were recently awarded a nearly $3 million National Science Foundation grant to fund a new framework for adaptive experimentation in classrooms and digital learning spaces. John Stamper answers questions about what his team of multidisciplinary researchers hopes to achieve.

"We are not going to succeed [in education] unless we really turn the problem around and first specify the kinds of things students ought to be doing: what are the cost-effective and time-effective ways by which students can proceed to learn. We need to carry out the analysis that is required to understand what they have to do — what activities will produce the learning —and then ask ourselves how the technology can help us do that."
 — Herbert Simon (1998)

 CMU Team Wins $1M XPRIZE Digital Learning ChallengeCarnegie Mellon University learning science researchers John Stamper, Norman Bier and Steven Moore are part of a team that won first place in the XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge, a competition to find and improve the most effective learning tools.

The Myth of the Fast LearnerLearning science experts from Carnegie Mellon University's Human Computer Interaction Institute found that, in the right conditions, people learn at a remarkably similar rate. Ken Koedinger, the Hillman Professor of Computer Science, led the research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Kumar Garg on the Future of Learning EngineeringKumar Garg from Schmidt Futures will present his 2022 Simon Initiative Distinguished Lecture, "Shaping the Field of Learning Engineering," at an in-person-only event at 5 p.m. on Nov. 7, 2022 in Carnegie Mellon University's Rangos Ballroom. In this Q&A, Garg explained why the field of learning engineering is at a crucial juncture. 

HCII Researchers Awarded $2M Grant To Test AI-Based Mobile Tutoring SoftwareCarnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science researchers in the Human-Computer Interaction Institute will use a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences to develop and test a smartphone-based tutoring system for middle school mathematics that's rooted in artificial intelligence.

AI-Powered Museum Exhibit Shows Technology's Potential in Education NoRILLA, a project from the School of Computer Science's Human-Computer Interaction Institute that uses artificial intelligence to assist children in hands-on educational experiments is one of six AI-focused projects selected for an exhibit at CaixaForum Valencia, a new museum in Valencia, Spain.

CMU Team Advances to Final Round of $1M XPRIZE CompetitionJohn Stamper, Norman Bier and Steven Moore are part of a multi-university team that has advanced to the final round of the XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge. The team has created a tool, Experiments as a Service Infrastructure (EASI), that educators can use to conduct experiments in the classroom.

The Future of Classroom ExperimentationCMU and its partners were recently awarded a nearly $3 million National Science Foundation grant to fund a new framework for adaptive experimentation in classrooms and digital learning spaces. John Stamper answers questions about what his team of multidisciplinary researchers hopes to achieve.

"We are not going to succeed [in education] unless we really turn the problem around and first specify the kinds of things students ought to be doing: what are the cost-effective and time-effective ways by which students can proceed to learn. We need to carry out the analysis that is required to understand what they have to do — what activities will produce the learning —and then ask ourselves how the technology can help us do that."
 — Herbert Simon (1998)
