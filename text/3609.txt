The 

Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network site
provides pointers useful to setting up your machine to play
AU sound files, such as are found in this directory, or 
converting the files to alternative formats.


File Compression
Some of the longer clips have been compressed with the GNU project's
GZIP program, which is available for a variety of operating 
systems, including the 

Macintosh,
DOS, and
UNIX.


Additions

I don't have the disk space to add more sounds, but would be more than
happy to add pointers to any you know about elsewhere.
