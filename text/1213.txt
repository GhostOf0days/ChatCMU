Statement of assumed/required prior knowledge
List of learning resources and whether they are required or supplementary (e.g., textbooks, software, etc.)
Course-level learning objectives that articulate what students should be able to do by the end of the course
Description of major assessments and how they contribute to the final grade
Statements and policies that clearly communicate your expectations regarding 

Attendance
Academic integrity, including collaboration and plagiarism
Late/make-up work
Accommodations for students with disabilities

Statements and policies that clearly communicate your expectations regarding

Participation
Re-grading
Use of mobile devices

 Faculty Senate Checklist
A recent Faculty Senate Resolution calls on CMU colleagues to give your students a syllabus no later than the day the course first meets or formally begins. In addition, this resolution makes the following recommendations regarding the contents of your syllabus.
The Faculty Senate recommends that you include the following in your syllabus:

Contact information for the instructor(s) and TA(s), including email, office hours/location, etc.
Course description that explains the course’s scope and purpose, format (e.g., lecture, recitation, lab, studio), relevance to students’ academic/professional goals, and major deliverables (e.g., project, presentation, paper, exhibit)
Statement of assumed/required prior knowledge
List of learning resources and whether they are required or supplementary (e.g., textbooks, software, etc.)
Course-level learning objectives that articulate what students should be able to do by the end of the course
Description of major assessments and how they contribute to the final grade
Statements and policies that clearly communicate your expectations regarding 

Attendance
Academic integrity, including collaboration and plagiarism
Late/make-up work
Accommodations for students with disabilities


Statement encouraging student wellness
Expected semester schedule
Diversity statement (based on Faculty Senate vote in August 2020)

Additionally, the Eberly Center recommends including the following in your syllabus:

Grading scale that lists the percentage credit or number of points corresponding to each letter grade
Statements and policies that clearly communicate your expectations regarding

Participation
Re-grading
Use of mobile devices
Student recording of class


Study Tips that could help increase students success in your course
Relevant campus resources (e.g., Student Academic Success Center (SASC)) that could provide supplementary assistance to students'
