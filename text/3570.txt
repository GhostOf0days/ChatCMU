I am interested in mobile robot autonomy. One of the first
problems encountered when robots operate outside controlled factory
and research environments is the need to perceive their surroundings. My
research focuses on efficient inference at the connection of linear
algebra and probabilistic graphical models for 3D mapping and
localization.

I have previously been a Research Scientist and a Postdoctoral
Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in
John Leonard's Marine
Robotics Lab. In 2008 I have received my PhD in Computer Science from
the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised
by Frank Dellaert.

I am interested in mobile robot autonomy. One of the first
problems encountered when robots operate outside controlled factory
and research environments is the need to perceive their surroundings. My
research focuses on efficient inference at the connection of linear
algebra and probabilistic graphical models for 3D mapping and
localization.

I have previously been a Research Scientist and a Postdoctoral
Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in
John Leonard's Marine
Robotics Lab. In 2008 I have received my PhD in Computer Science from
the Georgia Institute of Technology, advised
by Frank Dellaert.
