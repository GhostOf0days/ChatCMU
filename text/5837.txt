The Dreadful Wreckage of History Studying Rubble Photography
The Dreadful Wreckage of History Studying Rubble Photography
In 1949, the year in which both German states were founded, Richard Peter, a Dresden photographer, published Eine Kamera klagt an with a print-run of 50,000 copies which quickly sold out.

New Media
New Media
The advent of digitally-mediated and networked technologies allowing user representation has led to the emergence of a variety of forms of communication.

Controversy, Art, and Power
Controversy, Art, and Power
Cultural sociologist Richard Howells will argue that controversies in the arts are rarely only about the arts. They do not happen within an aesthetic vacuum.

Case studies range from punk rock to theatre and the fine arts.

Performing Place, Performing Peace
Since the Belfast Agreement of 1998, Northern Ireland has been undergoing a transformation into an uneasy and unfolding peace. A significant aspect of the transformation of the violent conflict that had been underway for some thirty years previously has been the ways in which space has been renegotiated and the ways in which space remains an area of contention.

Daggers of the Mind

Robot Ethics
Robot Ethics
Robotics is advancing rapidly through categories of human capability, and pundits on all sides are debating the robot futures we may face: existential threat (Elon Musk, Bill Gates), or bringer of the Age of Plenty (Hans Moravec, Kurzweil) or robber of human jobs (McAfee, Summers) or transition to a new work style (Larry Page)?

Neither Here Nor There
The work has evolved out of a Belfast context heavily inscribed by the visual components of social, political and national affiliations where meaning is not neutral. Northernness is a recurring theme. Not just the physical and psychological reality of the North of Ireland, but the very sense of "Northernness" both as an interior wilderness and a place at the edge of imagination.

The Dreadful Wreckage of History Studying Rubble Photography
In 1949, the year in which both German states were founded, Richard Peter, a Dresden photographer, published Eine Kamera klagt an with a print-run of 50,000 copies which quickly sold out. The book is an example of Trümmerfotografie, rubble or wreckage photography that documented the destruction of the German cities in the immediate postwar years.

The advent of digitally-mediated and networked technologies allowing user representation has led to the emergence of a variety of forms of communication.

Controversy, Art, and Power
Controversy, Art, and Power
Cultural sociologist Richard Howells will argue that controversies in the arts are rarely only about the arts. They do not happen within an aesthetic vacuum. While he agrees that some controversies are deliberately created for publicity and commercial reasons, Howells stresses the greater importance of the power dynamic in both the making and the understanding of controversy. Case studies range from punk rock to theatre and the fine arts.

n the United States, government-supported public art is traditionally assumed to be an act of citizenship, that is, supportive of values associated with democracy. However, many pieces of public art that trumpet democratic values also serve autocratic forces.
