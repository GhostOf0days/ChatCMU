Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
At its foundation, the School of Computer Science is a collective and expansive community, committed to equity and inclusivity. As a global community it is crucial that SCS be welcoming and inclusive in order to achieve excellence in the instruction, research and application of computer science. We work to ensure equal access for students, staff and faculty from diverse backgrounds.We also recognize that the institutions in our country must be change agents in order to create a more just and equitable world. With our legacy of creating data-driven solutions to solve difficult real-world problems, CMU and SCS stand uniquely positioned to positively affect the trajectory of this transformation.To that end, SCS has come together to create pledges to support our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts you'll find below.
