     Advocated by the Director
“Our people are our greatest asset.”
At the SEI, we use that CMU principle as our touchstone for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Seeking and cultivating diverse populations and perspectives, promoting and practicing equity and inclusion—these activities crystallize the truth that our people are central to our mission and catalyze their continual growth and development. We build on those actions as an organization, as well, to nurture and sustain a diverse, equitable, and inclusive community that advances science and technology to make our national defense and security software-based systems more innovative, more trustworthy, and more affordable. Each person. Each day. Each team. Each project.
