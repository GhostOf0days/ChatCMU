The School of Art Announces Faculty Appointments in Critical Studies and Electronic and Time-Based Media
Posted on May 14, 2018The School of Art at Carnegie Mellon University is pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Jongwoo Jeremy Kim as Associate Professor in the area of Critical Studies and Johannes DeYoung as Assistant Professor in the area of Electronic and Time-Based Media. Both will begin teaching in the Fall 2018 semester.
Dr. Jongwoo Jeremy Kim is a specialist of modern and contemporary art, addressing issues concerning gender, race, and sexuality. He is the author of Painted Men in Britain, 1868-1918: Royal Academicians and Masculinities (2012; 2016), and he co-edited with Christopher Reed the interdisciplinary anthology Queer Difficulty in Art and Poetry: Rethinking the Sexed Body in Verse and Visual Culture (2017). This anthology includes his essay on queer temporality and late twentieth-century sculpture, “Now and (N)ever: Robert Gober’s Beeswax Time Machines.” Kim is currently working on his next book, Transplanted: Wandering Body Parts and the Queer Uncanny, which evaluates the “becomings” of modernism and postmodernism through the subversive visuality of queer body politics.
Kim comes to Carnegie Mellon University from the University of Louisville, where he was Associate Professor of Art History. He currently serves as President of the Historians of British Art, an international organization for scholars and curators specializing in British art and architecture from every area and period. Kim received his Ph.D. in Art History from the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, where he worked with acclaimed feminist art historian Linda Nochlin.
“Jongwoo Kim’s scholarship pushes us to examine the complexities of art in postcolonial contemporary society through a broader and more global lens,” said Head of School Charlie White. “His scholarship and teaching will help to challenge students to think about visual culture, critical discourse, and identity in a new light, encouraging a more considered approach to their own art making.”
Johannes DeYoung is an artist whose work in experimental animation and time-based media explores themes of animism and human psychology. His practice frequently engages forms that blend computer animation with experimental processes in painting and drawing. DeYoung’s work has been exhibited internationally, with works included in the B3 Biennale of the Moving Image, Frankfurt, Germany and the Images Festival at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, Canada. His work has been exhibited at Crush Curatorial, Robert Miller Gallery, Jeff Bailey Gallery, Eyebeam, and Tiger Strikes Asteroid in New York City, and at Pallas Projects, Dublin, Ireland and Hell Gallery, Melbourne, Australia.
At Carnegie Mellon, DeYoung will teach animation courses in the School of Art and in the IDeATe program. He comes to CMU from Yale University, where he was Senior Critic and Director of the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media, an interdisciplinary arts research center. DeYoung also taught course in animation in the School of Art and was Lecturer in Design in the School of Drama at Yale.
“Johannes DeYoung’s artistic practice and approach to teaching emphasize interdisciplinary approaches at every turn, a cornerstone of art education at Carnegie Mellon University,” said White. “His expertise and dedication to engaging students in experimental art making will bolster our education in time-based and new media, already ranked as the best in the country.”
Rated the No. 6 art school in the United States, and No. 1 in the area of time-based and new media by U.S. News and World Report, CMU’s School of Art stands among the world’s leading programs. Housed within one of the most respected research universities in the United States, the School offers an unparalleled convergence of contemporary art, technology, and critical discourse with distinguished alumni including Andy Warhol, Mel Bochner, Joyce Kozloff, Philip Pearlstein, Deborah Kass, and John Currin.
