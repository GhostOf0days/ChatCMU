 Startups at the Swartz Center



 The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship welcomes all Carnegie Mellon University current and alumni entrepreneurs and startups. Our brand new space in the Tepper Quad was made possible thanks to a generous gift by alumnus and entrepreneur James R. Swartz.
The Swartz Center space covers over 8,000 square feet with 10 built in "garage" office spaces. Each garage is home to a startup founded by Carnegie Mellon University alumni, undergraduates, graduates, post-docs and faculty. Additionally, multiple dedicated and first-come-first-serve tables are available throughout the open space for any approved Carnegie Mellon University related startups to use.

First-Come First-Served Tables


Approved entrepreneurs who are still working on exploring their entrepreneurship idea or are in the early stages of their startup are welcome to use any of the available first-come first-served tables.
They also have 24-hour access to the space and are able to request reservations for the Swartz Center conference rooms.

Dedicated Tables


Entrepreneurs who have demonstrated significant progress and commitment to their startup through their work at the Swartz Center are assigned a dedicated table.
Dedicated tables are clearly marked with the startups logo and/or name and are reserved for use only by that startup. Lockers are assigned to each dedicated table for storage of items overnight.

Garages


Use of one of the ten Swartz Center garages is reserved for the entrepreneurs who have shown the most progress, committment, and dedication to their startup.
Garages are assigned by the Swartz Center Access Committee and are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The target duration for a startup in a garage is a year.

Project Olympus


Project Olympus space, located just off campus, also has offices, dedicated desks and co-working space. Startups can work out of the Swartz Center Main Campus and also sign up for Project Olympus to tap into additional resources to help with finding product/market fit, developing your business model, making connections and attracting funding. Project Olympus will team you up with a business coach to develop a personalized ‘roadmap.

 Startups at the Swartz Center



 The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship welcomes all Carnegie Mellon University current and alumni entrepreneurs and startups. Our brand new space in the Tepper Quad was made possible thanks to a generous gift by alumnus and entrepreneur James R. Swartz.
The Swartz Center space covers over 8,000 square feet with 10 built in "garage" office spaces. Each garage is home to a startup founded by Carnegie Mellon University alumni, undergraduates, graduates, post-docs and faculty. Additionally, multiple dedicated and first-come-first-serve tables are available throughout the open space for any approved Carnegie Mellon University related startups to use.

First-Come First-Served Tables


Approved entrepreneurs who are still working on exploring their entrepreneurship idea or are in the early stages of their startup are welcome to use any of the available first-come first-served tables.
They also have 24-hour access to the space and are able to request reservations for the Swartz Center conference rooms.

Dedicated Tables


Entrepreneurs who have demonstrated significant progress and commitment to their startup through their work at the Swartz Center are assigned a dedicated table.
Dedicated tables are clearly marked with the startups logo and/or name and are reserved for use only by that startup. Lockers are assigned to each dedicated table for storage of items overnight.

Garages


Use of one of the ten Swartz Center garages is reserved for the entrepreneurs who have shown the most progress, committment, and dedication to their startup.
Garages are assigned by the Swartz Center Access Committee and are reviewed on a quarterly basis. The target duration for a startup in a garage is a year.

Project Olympus


Project Olympus space, located just off campus, also has offices, dedicated desks and co-working space. Startups can work out of the Swartz Center Main Campus and also sign up for Project Olympus to tap into additional resources to help with finding product/market fit, developing your business model, making connections and attracting funding. Project Olympus will team you up with a business coach to develop a personalized ‘roadmap.

 Startups at the Swartz Center


 The Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship welcomes all Carnegie Mellon University current and alumni entrepreneurs and startups. Our brand new space in the Tepper Quad was made possible thanks to a generous gift by alumnus and entrepreneur James R. Swartz.
The Swartz Center space covers over 8,000 square feet with 10 built in "garage" office spaces. Each garage is home to a startup founded by Carnegie Mellon University alumni, undergraduates, graduates, post-docs and faculty. Additionally, multiple dedicated and first-come-first-serve tables are available throughout the open space for any approved Carnegie Mellon University related startups to use.
