Confronting Racism and Promoting Equity and Inclusion



 


 At Carnegie Mellon University, we approach challenges with trademark fearlessness and a commitment to impact.  
Like many institutions across the nation and the world, CMU has been examining our role in the fight to confront racism and promote social justice, inclusion and economic empowerment. Now more than ever, we must work together as a community to bring diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) into greater focus across Carnegie Mellon. 
On July 2, 2020, President Farnam Jahanian wrote to the university community to share a set of commitments and action items focused on accelerating this important work.
"As our society continues to grapple with racism and systemic injustice and as the CMU community unites in dialogue on how to fully realize its DEI goals, every member of our community has a role to play in supporting these efforts, and a responsibility to find ways to engage with these topics." — President Farnam Jahanian
The leadership team, along with the campus community, is committed to ensuring that Carnegie Mellon stands on the right side of history through bold and concrete actions, and to maintaining transparency and accountability as our plan is executed.
