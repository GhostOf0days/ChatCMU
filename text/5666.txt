 The Sustainability Initiative at CMU
Toward a more sustainable future—for everyone.





As a university, we’re collectively advancing efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, which each contribute to making the world a better place. 
Not just for how we live today, but for generations to come. 
 

 We’re amplifying efforts across three key areas:





Education
Integrating sustainability across educational efforts






Research
Identifying and connecting contributors—at CMU and beyond






Practices
Supporting decision-making and guiding activities



 

 
Join us as we create solutions, drive strategies and integrate efforts across our campus. Because progress takes all of us.
