The exhibition is on view June 16 through August 16.“Play Societies: Wolves, Lynx and Ants” is a narrative exhibition project with three allegories: “Steppenwolf on the info superhighway,” “The lynx refuge island,” and “The ants arcade”. Using these three animals as prototypes of human society in different stages of development in media technology, it reveals the contradiction between network society and individual situations.

The original 3 Sided Football was conceived by Danish Situationist Asger Jorn in 1964. The soccer variant was meant to explain the concept of Triolectics, a general model of interpretation that could take into account fluid alliances, betrayals and collaborations beyond rigid binary conflicts.

The project presents an exploration of consent and the politics, tactics and practices of the male pick-up artist and seduction communities. Through the format of a dating simulator, players experience the practices of several infamous seduction coaches (aka pick-up artists). In the game, these pick-up gurus attempt to seduce the player using their signature techniques taken directly from their instruction and videos materials. By pitting players against six prominent seduction coaches who are vying for their attention at a bar, the game provides them with the opportunity to explore the complexity of the construction of social behaviors around dating as well as the experience of being a femme-presenting individual navigating this complicated and often dangerous terrain.
