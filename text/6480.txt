Caroline Yoo MFA ’23 Performs in Online Event “Sacred Wounds – Warrior”
Posted on November 16, 2020
Caroline Yoo will perform in the monthly event “Sacred Wounds” on November 21 at 10 PM ET. This month, the series focuses on the theme ‘Warrior.’
In former times, a ‘warrior’ was defined to be a brave or experienced soldier or fighter. They fought external wars against a foe and on battlegrounds with skills of weaponry.
In present day, there is a new warrior. We all face battles—some external, some internal, or both at different times of our lives. What constitutes a warrior in our eyes is someone who gets back up, who keeps going, despite the self doubt and self criticism. Vulnerability, perseverance, authenticity … is now a superpower.
“Sacred Wounds” is produced by Wang Newton and Coco Ono.
