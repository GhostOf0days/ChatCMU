Over the past decade, machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly in both popularity and complexity. Driven by advances in deep neural networks, ML is now being applied far beyond its traditional domains like computer vision and text processing, with applications…

Safety Envelopes using Light Curtains with Probabilistic Guarantees










November 19, 2021



The safety envelope (in green) is an imaginary surface that separates the robot from all obstacles in its environment. As long as the robot never intersects the safety envelope, it is guaranteed to not collide with any obstacle. Our task…

PLAS: Latent Action Space for Offline Reinforcement Learning










April 30, 2021



 Overview: To avoid out-of-distribution actions in the Offline Reinforcement Learning problem, we propose to implicitly constrain the policy by modifying the action space instead of enforcing explicit constraints. The policy is trained to output a latent action which will…

Plan2Explore: Active Model-Building for Self-Supervised Visual Reinforcement Learning










October 6, 2020



To operate successfully in unstructured open-world environments, autonomous intelligent agents need to solve many different tasks and learn new tasks quickly. Reinforcement learning has enabled artificial agents to solve complex tasks both in simulation and real world. However, it requires…

Policy Certificates and Minimax-Optimal PAC Bounds for Episodic Reinforcement Learning










August 16, 2019



Designing reinforcement learning methods which find a good policy with as few samples as possible is a key goal of both empirical and theoretical research. On the theoretical side there are two main ways, regret- or PAC (probably approximately correct)…

Representer Point Selection for Explaining Deep Neural Networks










April 19, 2019



Why did a Deep Neural Network (DNN) make a certain prediction? Although DNNs have been shown to be extremely accurate predictors in a range of domains, they are still largely black-box functions—even to the experts who train them—due to their…

TIDEE: An Embodied Agent that Tidies Up Novel Rooms using Commonsense Priors










April 14, 2023



Example of embodied commonsense reasoning. A robot proactively identifies a remote on the floor and knows it is out of place without instruction. Then, the robot figures out where to place it in the scene and manipulates it there. For…

RLPrompt: Optimizing Discrete Text Prompts with Reinforcement Learning










February 24, 2023



Figure 1: Overview of RL Prompt for discrete prompt optimization. All language models (LMs) are frozen. We build our policy network by training a task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network inserted into a frozen pre-trained LM. The figure above illustrates 1)…
