How did that happen? AJ: Some Texas residents signed contracts for time-varying electricity prices, which are prices that vary by hour in order to reflect the cost of electricity production in the hour. Due to the extreme weather event, time-varying prices reflected that electricity was extremely valuable in those hours—a similar example would be when prices for Uber surge during a crisis situation. Traditionally, economists think of prices as allocating a good to those who value it most. When electricity is scarce, the conventional thinking is that prices should be very high to reflect the value of electricity. That being said, this conventional model assumes that people can allocate scarce attention to electricity prices during a crisis. In addition, many individuals, businesses and institutions do not face time-varying prices and were thus were not in a position to decide how much electricity to consume, given its high value at the time.
