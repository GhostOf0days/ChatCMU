A recent trend on the Web is a demand for higher levels of expressiveness 
in the mechanisms that mediate interactions such as the allocation of 
resources, matching of peers, or elicitation of opinions.  In this paper, we 
demonstrate the need for greater expressiveness in privacy mechanisms,
which 
control the conditions under which private information is shared on the Web.  
We begin by adapting our recent theoretical framework for characterizing 
expressiveness to this domain. By leveraging prior results, we are able to 
prove that any increase in allowed expressiveness for privacy mechanisms leads 
to a strict improvement in their efficiency (i.e., the ability of 
individuals 
to share information without violating their privacy constraints). We 
validate these theoretical results with a week-long human subject experiment, 
where we tracked the locations of $30$ subjects.  Each day we collected their 
stated ground truth privacy preferences regarding sharing their locations with 
different groups of people. Our results confirm that i) most subjects had 
relatively complex privacy preferences, and ii) that privacy mechanisms with 
higher levels of expressiveness are significantly more efficient in this 
domain.
