CMU graduate students share what fellowships make possible in their livesBy Meagen Fekos and Eric HoffmanChoosing the right graduate program requires students to think about much more than which institution has the best program. Graduate students often are juggling rigorous coursework and research with providing for themselves and their loved ones. They also must find the time and resources to network and build their careers.At CMU, donors have been key to addressing those needs and eliminating financial barriers to advanced degrees. In the past five academic years, 1,389 graduate students have been awarded 1,946 fellowships to help further their education and research pursuits by providing resources for tuition, stipends, professional development and research activities.“Truly, I think fellowship is opportunity,” fellowship recipient Jasmine Roth said. “I wouldn’t be able to be at Carnegie Mellon without that.”The video above explores what donor support makes it possible for students like Christophe, Kate, Jasmine and Tafadzwa as they pursue their aspirations, conduct innovative research and creative opportunities, and lead the future of their fields.Tafadzwa Chigumira is the recipient of the CIT Presidential Fellowship. She is a doctoral candidate studying chemical engineering.Christophe Johnson is an MBA candidate at the Tepper School of Business, focusing on strategy, business technologies, marketing and entrepreneurship.

He is also a student-in-residence for a Pittsburgh-based AI and machine learning startup and a venture capital firm.Christophe is a founding member of Carnegie Autonomous Racing, a student government-recognized organization, where he led the business development team, securing funding from major donors like Applied Intuition, SKU| Custom Robots and Machines and Blue Origin. With a strong background in technology, consulting and product management, he co-founded a Florida-based edtech startup and currently serves as its product manager. Christophe is also a committed mentor, helping undergraduate business students secure internships and fellowships at prestigious banks and consulting firms.After completing his MBA, he will join Intuit as a product marketing manager. Passionate about innovation, marketing, and technology, Christophe looks forward to contributing to the university’s philanthropy efforts in the future.The recipient of a GEM Fellowship and ARCS Scholar Award, Kate Johnson is a doctoral candidate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering who studies air quality and climate modeling.

Choosing the right graduate program requires students to think about much more than which institution has the best program. Graduate students often are juggling rigorous coursework and research with providing for themselves and their loved ones. They also must find the time and resources to network and build their careers.
At CMU, donors have been key to addressing those needs and eliminating financial barriers to advanced degrees. In the past five academic years, 1,389 graduate students have been awarded 1,946 fellowships to help further their education and research pursuits by providing resources for tuition, stipends, professional development and research activities.
“Truly, I think fellowship is opportunity,” fellowship recipient Jasmine Roth said. “I wouldn’t be able to be at Carnegie Mellon without that.”
The video above explores what donor support makes it possible for students like Christophe, Kate, Jasmine and Tafadzwa as they pursue their aspirations, conduct innovative research and creative opportunities, and lead the future of their fields.

Choosing the right graduate program requires students to think about much more than which institution has the best program. Graduate students often are juggling rigorous coursework and research with providing for themselves and their loved ones. They also must find the time and resources to network and build their careers.
At CMU, donors have been key to addressing those needs and eliminating financial barriers to advanced degrees. In the past five academic years, 1,389 graduate students have been awarded 1,946 fellowships to help further their education and research pursuits by providing resources for tuition, stipends, professional development and research activities.
“Truly, I think fellowship is opportunity,” fellowship recipient Jasmine Roth said. “I wouldn’t be able to be at Carnegie Mellon without that.”
The video above explores what donor support makes it possible for students like Christophe, Kate, Jasmine and Tafadzwa as they pursue their aspirations, conduct innovative research and creative opportunities, and lead the future of their fields.

Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Mellon College of Science

Michael Young joined Carnegie Mellon University’s Mellon College of Science as the first associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and works to foster a diverse and inclusive community that supports the college’s faculty, staff and students.
He earned his Ph.D. in mathematical sciences at CMU in 2008 and maintained a close relationship with the university in the years since as an instructor in CMU’s Summer Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute and Summer Academy for Math and Sciences.
During his career, Young started a number of nationwide initiatives and held several leadership roles geared towards addressing race and inequity in education. He founded the networking organization, the Center for Minorities in the Mathematical Sciences, and the Mathematics Enrichment through Diversity and Learning (MEDAL) organization. MEDAL provides diversity training and professional development to teachers and faculty as well as tutoring and mentoring services through the United Negro College Fund’s STEM Scholar Program and through CMU’s Tartan Scholars Program.
Young also serves as a faculty member in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. His research is in discrete mathematics, specifically graph theory, combinatorics and applications to combinatorial matrix theory.

Choosing the right graduate program requires students to think about much more than which institution has the best program. Graduate students often are juggling rigorous coursework and research with providing for themselves and their loved ones. They also must find the time and resources to network and build their careers.
At CMU, donors have been key to addressing those needs and eliminating financial barriers to advanced degrees. In the past five academic years, 1,389 graduate students have been awarded 1,946 fellowships to help further their education and research pursuits by providing resources for tuition, stipends, professional development and research activities.
“Truly, I think fellowship is opportunity,” fellowship recipient Jasmine Roth said. “I wouldn’t be able to be at Carnegie Mellon without that.”
The video above explores what donor support makes it possible for students like Christophe, Kate, Jasmine and Tafadzwa as they pursue their aspirations, conduct innovative research and creative opportunities, and lead the future of their fields.

Michael Young
Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, Mellon College of Science

Michael Young joined Carnegie Mellon University’s Mellon College of Science as the first associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and works to foster a diverse and inclusive community that supports the college’s faculty, staff and students.
He earned his Ph.D. in mathematical sciences at CMU in 2008 and maintained a close relationship with the university in the years since as an instructor in CMU’s Summer Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute and Summer Academy for Math and Sciences.
During his career, Young started a number of nationwide initiatives and held several leadership roles geared towards addressing race and inequity in education. He founded the networking organization, the Center for Minorities in the Mathematical Sciences, and the Mathematics Enrichment through Diversity and Learning (MEDAL) organization. MEDAL provides diversity training and professional development to teachers and faculty as well as tutoring and mentoring services through the United Negro College Fund’s STEM Scholar Program and through CMU’s Tartan Scholars Program.
Young also serves as a faculty member in the Department of Mathematical Sciences. His research is in discrete mathematics, specifically graph theory, combinatorics and applications to combinatorial matrix theory.
