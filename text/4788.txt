August 15, 2023—The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is hosting Zero Trust Industry Days 2023 to collect information from those who develop solutions for implementing a zero trust architecture. The hybrid event takes place October 25-26 virtually and at the SEI in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Presenters will contribute their ideas, solutions, and experiences for helping organizations form a zero trust implementation that meets their mission goals, budget, and time frame. The SEI invites providers of zero trust solutions, including vendors, federally funded research and development centers, and other research organizations, to apply to present at the event by September 22.Zero Trust Industry Days is a request for information (RFI) exercise focusing on how organizations can comply with the following guidance documents:Selected presenters will provide a zero trust architecture solution for a scenario in which a company is setting up a chip manufacturing facility on an island that may lose connectivity and cloud services for short or extended periods of time.“The scenario will enable presenters to highlight their ability to implement a zero trust strategy in a resilient way at the enterprise, operational technology, and Internet of Things levels,” said Tim Morrow, the SEI’s technical manager of situational awareness and the event’s organizer.The event will also feature panel talks, keynote speakers, and summary sessions.The zero trust security model moves away from the risks associated with perimeter-based security by requiring authentication and authorization of every subject, asset, and workflow within an organization’s information technology network or system. The approach is a set of organizational practices, not a piece of technology. A zero trust architecture is an enterprise cybersecurity plan that incorporates zero trust tenets into components specified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-207.Submit a presentation proposal for Zero Trust Industry Days 2023 online by September 22.
