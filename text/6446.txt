707 Gallery Presents Solo Show by Steve Alexis MFA ’24
Posted on April 24, 2023
707 Gallery in downtown Pittsburgh presents “in spite of me, here you are”, a solo exhibition by Steve Alexis MFA ’24, from March 10 through June 11.
We ask questions to gain new knowledge or reach some sort of understanding. By simply asking questions, things can be revealed to us. But what happens when we are left with just questions? When the unknowing plagues your everyday life?
“in spite of me, here you are” deals with loss of identity, the indeterminate, and living in terror. Through painting, sculptural objects, and video, Alexis explores the idea of sitting with the uncertain, the unrealized idea of oneself, and the internal tumult of questioning our identity.
These objects allude to religious tradition: the specter of a cross, which is both representational, and functional in the context of the construction of the works, portals which have a sacred history of having served as pathways that connect the Heavenly realm and the earthly realm, and works that fall asunder as if they are falling from grace, or simply looking for respite.
This exhibition aims to highlight how the personal self is represented in an artist’s work, and the complexities of exploring conventions while on a quest for understanding. People’s experiences can alter how they see themselves or are perceived by others, and therefore can alter how artwork is perceived as well. With these works, Alexis hopes that the viewer will gain new perspectives and understanding of other people’s lives, and perhaps be influenced in their own search for identity.
