Applicants may also submit a short prior publication related to their research interests.Computational Biology Ph.D. and Master's Applicants: If you're applying to our Ph.D., MSAS or MSCB programs, you can include an optional paragraph — in addition to your research interests, experience and objectives — that describes your contributions to outreach efforts and/or promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Applicants: A Statement of Purpose is not a resume. We are looking for significant, reliable evidence that you can succeed in the rigorous MSAII program.  In additional to strong academics, it is beneficial to show evidence that you can work as a contributing member of a team.  You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Most important, your statement of purpose should be written solely by you and provide an accurate summary of your experiences, goals and reasons for applying to the MSAII program.Master's in Computational Data Science Applicants: We are looking for strong, experience-based evidence that you can do well in our degree program and that you “fit” based on our areas of focus. For example, a description of a large software or research project, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. An explanation of what drew your interest to the MCDS program and how it relates to your professional goals is also useful. You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Although details regarding your personal interests and background can be helpful, they are not part of our admissions criteria and should not constitute the bulk of your statement of purpose. Most importantly, your statement of purpose should be written by you and provide an accurate representation of your experiences and goals.Master's in Computer Science Applicants: Discuss your purpose in pursuing a master's degree in computer science. For example, you might explain how advanced study in computer science fits into your future career ambitions. There are no right answers, and you do not need to have worked out your future plans in detail. We just want to see that you have thought your purpose through. If your background is unusual, this is also the right place to explain it to us.Master's in Software Engineering Applicants: Describe any team-oriented software development experiences you have had. (If there are numerous examples, pick two or three.) Briefly describe the nature of the projects, the general technologies involved, how many engineers were on your team and your role on the team. Describe your short-term goals (2-4 years) and long-term goals (5-7 years) upon graduation from this program. Feel free to explain your goals in terms of relevant roles, domains, organizational technologies, expertise and so forth. Describe specifically how the program to which you are applying, and CMU more generally, align with your professional objectives.Master's in Robotic Systems and Development Applicants: Provide some background information on your academic/industrial career to date, and why/how that leads you to be interested in CMU's unique industry-oriented MRSD program. It would be helpful for the committee to understand your career aspirations, how you imagine the mix of technical/management education from MRSD would assist you in achieving these, and what you see yourself doing five to 10 years after graduation.Qatar CampusSilicon Valley Campus

Applicants may also submit a short prior publication related to their research interests.Computational Biology Ph.D. and Master's Applicants: If you're applying to our Ph.D., MSAS or MSCB programs, you can include an optional paragraph — in addition to your research interests, experience and objectives — that describes your contributions to outreach efforts and/or promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Applicants: A Statement of Purpose is not a resume. We are looking for significant, reliable evidence that you can succeed in the rigorous MSAII program.  In additional to strong academics, it is beneficial to show evidence that you can work as a contributing member of a team.  You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Most important, your statement of purpose should be written solely by you and provide an accurate summary of your experiences, goals and reasons for applying to the MSAII program.Master's in Computational Data Science Applicants: We are looking for strong, experience-based evidence that you can do well in our degree program and that you “fit” based on our areas of focus. For example, a description of a large software or research project, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. An explanation of what drew your interest to the MCDS program and how it relates to your professional goals is also useful. You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Although details regarding your personal interests and background can be helpful, they are not part of our admissions criteria and should not constitute the bulk of your statement of purpose. Most importantly, your statement of purpose should be written by you and provide an accurate representation of your experiences and goals.Master's in Computer Science Applicants: Discuss your purpose in pursuing a master's degree in computer science. For example, you might explain how advanced study in computer science fits into your future career ambitions. There are no right answers, and you do not need to have worked out your future plans in detail. We just want to see that you have thought your purpose through. If your background is unusual, this is also the right place to explain it to us.Master's in Software Engineering Applicants: Describe any team-oriented software development experiences you have had. (If there are numerous examples, pick two or three.) Briefly describe the nature of the projects, the general technologies involved, how many engineers were on your team and your role on the team. Describe your short-term goals (2-4 years) and long-term goals (5-7 years) upon graduation from this program. Feel free to explain your goals in terms of relevant roles, domains, organizational technologies, expertise and so forth. Describe specifically how the program to which you are applying, and CMU more generally, align with your professional objectives.Master's in Robotic Systems and Development Applicants: Provide some background information on your academic/industrial career to date, and why/how that leads you to be interested in CMU's unique industry-oriented MRSD program. It would be helpful for the committee to understand your career aspirations, how you imagine the mix of technical/management education from MRSD would assist you in achieving these, and what you see yourself doing five to 10 years after graduation.

SCS Graduate Application Instructions
To apply for admission to our master's and/or doctoral programs, read the following instructions carefully and make certain that you have met all requirements when you submit your application. You can apply to up to three doctoral programs and any of the master's programs.Application FeeThe application fee is $100 per program. If you apply before the early deadline of Nov. 29, 2023 (3 p.m. EST), then the application fee is $80 per program.
If you submit your application early, your recommenders still have until Dec. 13, 2023, to submit recommendations.Application Fee Waivers: We expect all applicants to submit payment with their online application. However, note that we do waive the required fee under certain circumstances. For information about how to apply for an application fee waiver, visit the SCS Graduate Application Fee Waiver Page.Test ScoresIf you need to take/retake your TOEFL, IELTS and/or GRE for this application, we highly recommend you take the exam no later than Nov. 29, 2023. Reportable scores can take two weeks to process and we may not be able to review any scores that arrive after our Dec. 13, 2023, deadline.Graduate Record Examination (GRE)Each program sets its policy on whether GRE scores are required and which test type is accepted. You can read short descriptions of each program's GRE policy below.Send scores via ETS using our SCS/CMU codes:
GRE Institution Code: 2074GRE Department Code: 0402GRE scores will not be accepted if they are more than five years old.Proof of English Language Proficiency (if applicable) If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you (native language…meaning spoken at home and from birth), we are required to formally evaluate your English proficiency.We require applicants who will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and for whom English is not a native language, to demonstrate English proficiency via one of these standardized tests: TOEFL (preferred), IELTS, or Duolingo. We discourage the use of the "TOEFL ITP Plus for China," since speaking is not scored.We do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English. In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college, or university. We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college, or university outside of the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver.  Some of our programs will accept expired test scores from applicants who have recently completed a degree in the United States, if the applicant can present a copy of an official score report showing the applicant's picture, not an unofficial score listing. Please consult the information for each specific program you apply to.Submit valid, recent scores: If as described above you are required to submit proof of English proficiency, your TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo test scores will be considered valid as follows: 
 If you have not received a bachelor’s degree in the U.S., you will need to submit a English proficiency score no older than two years. (Test scores taken before Sept. 1, 2021, will not be accepted.)If you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S., you may submit an expired test score up to five years old. (Test scores taken before Sept. 1, 2018, will not be accepted.)
Important: Applicants applying to MCDS and MHCI are required to submit scores from an English proficiency exam taken within the last two years. Scores taken before Sept. 1, 2021, will not be accepted regardless of whether you have previously studied in the U.S. For more information about their English proficiency score policies, visit the MCDS or MHCI admissions websites. Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) Send scores via ETS using our SCS/CMU codes:
TOEFL Institution Code: 4256TOEFL Department Code: 78A successful applicant will normally have a total iBT score of at least 100.International English Language Testing System (IELTS) 
We prefer that you take the TOEFL, but we will accept the IELTS.The same restrictions of expiration dates apply with an IELTS.An IELTS score of 7 is equivalent to a TOEFL score of 100.We accept IELTS scores through E-delivery. Please use the information below when setting up your IELTS scores for delivery to our institution.Account Name: Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer ScienceAddress: School of Computer Science5000 Forbes AvenuePittsburgh, PA 15213

If appropriate to your background, you may include a link to your portfolio.Societal Computing Ph.D. Applicants: Indicate your intended area in the first paragraph of your Statement of Purpose, along with the name of a possible advisor. For those with industrial or government experience, describe how this experience prepares you for graduate-level academic work. Submit this information in the Supplemental Information section under Experience (Research, Industry) in the online application. Applicants may also submit a short prior publication related to their research interests.Computational Biology Ph.D. and Master's Applicants: If you're applying to our Ph.D., MSAS or MSCB programs, you can include an optional paragraph — in addition to your research interests, experience and objectives — that describes your contributions to outreach efforts and/or promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Applicants: A Statement of Purpose is not a resume. We are looking for significant, reliable evidence that you can succeed in the rigorous MSAII program.  In additional to strong academics, it is beneficial to show evidence that you can work as a contributing member of a team.  You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Most important, your statement of purpose should be written solely by you and provide an accurate summary of your experiences, goals and reasons for applying to the MSAII program.Master's in Computational Data Science Applicants: We are looking for strong, experience-based evidence that you can do well in our degree program and that you “fit” based on our areas of focus. For example, a description of a large software or research project, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. An explanation of what drew your interest to the MCDS program and how it relates to your professional goals is also useful. You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Although details regarding your personal interests and background can be helpful, they are not part of our admissions criteria and should not constitute the bulk of your statement of purpose. Most importantly, your statement of purpose should be written by you and provide an accurate representation of your experiences and goals.Master's in Computer Science Applicants: Discuss your purpose in pursuing a master's degree in computer science. For example, you might explain how advanced study in computer science fits into your future career ambitions. There are no right answers, and you do not need to have worked out your future plans in detail. We just want to see that you have thought your purpose through. If your background is unusual, this is also the right place to explain it to us.Master's in Software Engineering Applicants: Describe any team-oriented software development experiences you have had. (If there are numerous examples, pick two or three.) Briefly describe the nature of the projects, the general technologies involved, how many engineers were on your team and your role on the team. Describe your short-term goals (2-4 years) and long-term goals (5-7 years) upon graduation from this program. Feel free to explain your goals in terms of relevant roles, domains, organizational technologies, expertise and so forth. Describe specifically how the program to which you are applying, and CMU more generally, align with your professional objectives.Master's in Robotic Systems and Development Applicants: Provide some background information on your academic/industrial career to date, and why/how that leads you to be interested in CMU's unique industry-oriented MRSD program. It would be helpful for the committee to understand your career aspirations, how you imagine the mix of technical/management education from MRSD would assist you in achieving these, and what you see yourself doing five to 10 years after graduation.

Applicants may also submit a short prior publication related to their research interests.Computational Biology Ph.D. and Master's Applicants: If you're applying to our Ph.D., MSAS or MSCB programs, you can include an optional paragraph — in addition to your research interests, experience and objectives — that describes your contributions to outreach efforts and/or promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.Master's in Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Applicants: A Statement of Purpose is not a resume. We are looking for significant, reliable evidence that you can succeed in the rigorous MSAII program.  In additional to strong academics, it is beneficial to show evidence that you can work as a contributing member of a team.  You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Most important, your statement of purpose should be written solely by you and provide an accurate summary of your experiences, goals and reasons for applying to the MSAII program.Master's in Computational Data Science Applicants: We are looking for strong, experience-based evidence that you can do well in our degree program and that you “fit” based on our areas of focus. For example, a description of a large software or research project, your involvement in the project, and the impact of the research is good evidence. An explanation of what drew your interest to the MCDS program and how it relates to your professional goals is also useful. You may also take this opportunity to explain any apparent weaknesses in your application. Although details regarding your personal interests and background can be helpful, they are not part of our admissions criteria and should not constitute the bulk of your statement of purpose. Most importantly, your statement of purpose should be written by you and provide an accurate representation of your experiences and goals.Master's in Computer Science Applicants: Discuss your purpose in pursuing a master's degree in computer science. For example, you might explain how advanced study in computer science fits into your future career ambitions. There are no right answers, and you do not need to have worked out your future plans in detail. We just want to see that you have thought your purpose through. If your background is unusual, this is also the right place to explain it to us.Master's in Software Engineering Applicants: Describe any team-oriented software development experiences you have had. (If there are numerous examples, pick two or three.) Briefly describe the nature of the projects, the general technologies involved, how many engineers were on your team and your role on the team. Describe your short-term goals (2-4 years) and long-term goals (5-7 years) upon graduation from this program. Feel free to explain your goals in terms of relevant roles, domains, organizational technologies, expertise and so forth. Describe specifically how the program to which you are applying, and CMU more generally, align with your professional objectives.Master's in Robotic Systems and Development Applicants: Provide some background information on your academic/industrial career to date, and why/how that leads you to be interested in CMU's unique industry-oriented MRSD program. It would be helpful for the committee to understand your career aspirations, how you imagine the mix of technical/management education from MRSD would assist you in achieving these, and what you see yourself doing five to 10 years after graduation.Statement of Purpose Instructions for Specific ProgramsHuman-Computer Interaction Ph.D. Applicants: Indicate your intended area of emphasis in the first paragraph of your Statement of Purpose.
