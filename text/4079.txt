 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Carnegie Mellon University and the Dietrich College for Humanities and Social Sciences value a dynamic and diverse community where all members are responsible for contributing to an inclusive environment.
The Dietrich College values diversity, equity and inclusion because:

diverse institutions function better than homogenous ones; and
equal opportunity for all is a moral imperative.

The college strives to promote a culture of respect, scholarship, innovation and integrity as we advance talented minds from diverse backgrounds. We aim to achieve these goals by implementing concrete practices at the center of our daily work that minimize bias and support diversity, by holding ourselves accountable to show progress and by attending to and revising these practices relentlessly.
In the Dietrich College, students, faculty and staff have opportunities to learn from one another, as well as from myriad cultural and academic resources. We challenge ourselves to consider the experiences and perspectives of others, engage and promote social justice and create meaningful connections to communities beyond our campus.
By harnessing our abilities as researchers, thinkers and educators, the Dietrich College will embrace difference and celebrate the richness of our diverse culture.

Diversity
We understand and value that every individual is unique. We see this uniqueness shaped by race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs and other life experiences and ideologies.

Equity
We are intentional about eliminating barriers that have prevented full participation and are working to increase access to resources and networks for underrepresented groups across our student, faculty and staff populations.

Inclusion
We believe that every person should feel as though they belong here. We are learning how to involve more unique perspectives and actively invite participation from historically underrepresented groups to make our community a better place for all.



 At Dietrich College, we each have a role in building an inclusive, equitable, and just community.





Better Together Learning Academy is one approach to providing the staff in our community with the tools to learn, explore, and convene to discuss topics such as microaggressions, cultural humility, understanding unconscious bias, and much more. The list of learning blocks was assembled based on staff interest. These learning blocks are self-paced and will guide you through your self-awareness and reflection to become an advocate in building a college that fosters a sense of belonging for everyone.
 

 Dietrich College Staff Community Excellence Award
The Dietrich College Staff Community Excellence Award is a college-level award recognizing individuals for contributions to increasing diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging both within and outside the university.
This staff award is for individuals who regularly go above and beyond expectations to create a more inclusive, just and welcoming community. Anyone from the Dietrich College community can nominate a Dietrich College staff member for this honor.  
Nominations open on Aug. 7, 2023, and close on Aug. 31, 2023. The award winner will be announced at the Sept. 26 Connections and Conversation Luncheon.

 Progress Highlights
Dietrich College has introduced several new programs and initiatives since the launch of its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan in fall 2020. The list below highlights a number of concrete steps the college has taken to make it a place where people of all identities, perspectives and experiences feel welcome, able to present their authentic selves and empowered to reach their full potential. View the Strategic Plan Progress Report for a comprehensive look at our five-year implementation process.




The Dietrich College created the DEI Implementation Committee to provide oversight on diversity, equity and inclusion issues and facilitate communication and accountability.


The Dietrich College faculty search committees incorporated procedural changes to minimize bias during searches. In doing so, we are expanding the pool of scholars to recruit to the college. 
As a result, we've hired new faculty members to expand the scope of scholarship in the college on issues like race, racism in medicine, critical race theory and cultural studies.


Carnegie Mellon University has expanded professional development opportunities for staff focused on civility, diversity, equity and inclusion. 
CMU also became a member of Vibrant Pittsburgh to connect staff, faculty and students with resources and events across the greater Pittsburgh area.


The Dietrich College is committed to making our college accessible to low-income, first-generation and/or underrepresented students in Pittsburgh through the LEAP program and the Arts Greenhouse. LEAP is a high school outreach program, in partnership with CFA. This high-quality, intensive year-round program with humanities and arts-focused programming launched in fall 2021. Arts Greenhouse is an arts and humanities education initiative that fosters the expressive and intellectual development of Pittsburgh’s youth.


Dietrich College has welcomed its second cohort for the Dietrich Scholars Fellowship. The Dietrich Scholars Fellowship is an exemplary group of diverse scholars pursuing degrees in the humanities and social sciences. It provides a pathway to success through financial support, opportunities to expand networks and professional development.


Dietrich College is leveraging the new general education curriculum to expand access to courses that cover topics in diversity, equity and inclusion. The new curriculum offers students opportunities to explore courses in intercultural and global inquiry as well as equity and justice. Students can choose from a dozen courses in each category throughout their education at the college.

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Carnegie Mellon University and the Dietrich College for Humanities and Social Sciences value a dynamic and diverse community where all members are responsible for contributing to an inclusive environment.
The Dietrich College values diversity, equity and inclusion because:

diverse institutions function better than homogenous ones; and
equal opportunity for all is a moral imperative.

The college strives to promote a culture of respect, scholarship, innovation and integrity as we advance talented minds from diverse backgrounds. We aim to achieve these goals by implementing concrete practices at the center of our daily work that minimize bias and support diversity, by holding ourselves accountable to show progress and by attending to and revising these practices relentlessly.
In the Dietrich College, students, faculty and staff have opportunities to learn from one another, as well as from myriad cultural and academic resources. We challenge ourselves to consider the experiences and perspectives of others, engage and promote social justice and create meaningful connections to communities beyond our campus.
By harnessing our abilities as researchers, thinkers and educators, the Dietrich College will embrace difference and celebrate the richness of our diverse culture.

Diversity
We understand and value that every individual is unique. We see this uniqueness shaped by race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs and other life experiences and ideologies.

Equity
We are intentional about eliminating barriers that have prevented full participation and are working to increase access to resources and networks for underrepresented groups across our student, faculty and staff populations.

Inclusion
We believe that every person should feel as though they belong here. We are learning how to involve more unique perspectives and actively invite participation from historically underrepresented groups to make our community a better place for all.



 At Dietrich College, we each have a role in building an inclusive, equitable, and just community.





Better Together Learning Academy is one approach to providing the staff in our community with the tools to learn, explore, and convene to discuss topics such as microaggressions, cultural humility, understanding unconscious bias, and much more. The list of learning blocks was assembled based on staff interest. These learning blocks are self-paced and will guide you through your self-awareness and reflection to become an advocate in building a college that fosters a sense of belonging for everyone.
 

 Dietrich College Staff Community Excellence Award
The Dietrich College Staff Community Excellence Award is a college-level award recognizing individuals for contributions to increasing diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging both within and outside the university.
This staff award is for individuals who regularly go above and beyond expectations to create a more inclusive, just and welcoming community. Anyone from the Dietrich College community can nominate a Dietrich College staff member for this honor.  
Nominations open on Aug. 7, 2023, and close on Aug. 31, 2023. The award winner will be announced at the Sept. 26 Connections and Conversation Luncheon.

 Progress Highlights
Dietrich College has introduced several new programs and initiatives since the launch of its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Strategic Plan in fall 2020. The list below highlights a number of concrete steps the college has taken to make it a place where people of all identities, perspectives and experiences feel welcome, able to present their authentic selves and empowered to reach their full potential. View the Strategic Plan Progress Report for a comprehensive look at our five-year implementation process.




The Dietrich College created the DEI Implementation Committee to provide oversight on diversity, equity and inclusion issues and facilitate communication and accountability.


The Dietrich College faculty search committees incorporated procedural changes to minimize bias during searches. In doing so, we are expanding the pool of scholars to recruit to the college. 
As a result, we've hired new faculty members to expand the scope of scholarship in the college on issues like race, racism in medicine, critical race theory and cultural studies.


Carnegie Mellon University has expanded professional development opportunities for staff focused on civility, diversity, equity and inclusion. 
CMU also became a member of Vibrant Pittsburgh to connect staff, faculty and students with resources and events across the greater Pittsburgh area.


The Dietrich College is committed to making our college accessible to low-income, first-generation and/or underrepresented students in Pittsburgh through the LEAP program and the Arts Greenhouse. LEAP is a high school outreach program, in partnership with CFA. This high-quality, intensive year-round program with humanities and arts-focused programming launched in fall 2021. Arts Greenhouse is an arts and humanities education initiative that fosters the expressive and intellectual development of Pittsburgh’s youth.


Dietrich College has welcomed its second cohort for the Dietrich Scholars Fellowship. The Dietrich Scholars Fellowship is an exemplary group of diverse scholars pursuing degrees in the humanities and social sciences. It provides a pathway to success through financial support, opportunities to expand networks and professional development.


Dietrich College is leveraging the new general education curriculum to expand access to courses that cover topics in diversity, equity and inclusion. The new curriculum offers students opportunities to explore courses in intercultural and global inquiry as well as equity and justice. Students can choose from a dozen courses in each category throughout their education at the college.

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Carnegie Mellon University and the Dietrich College for Humanities and Social Sciences value a dynamic and diverse community where all members are responsible for contributing to an inclusive environment.
The Dietrich College values diversity, equity and inclusion because:

diverse institutions function better than homogenous ones; and
equal opportunity for all is a moral imperative.

The college strives to promote a culture of respect, scholarship, innovation and integrity as we advance talented minds from diverse backgrounds. We aim to achieve these goals by implementing concrete practices at the center of our daily work that minimize bias and support diversity, by holding ourselves accountable to show progress and by attending to and revising these practices relentlessly.
In the Dietrich College, students, faculty and staff have opportunities to learn from one another, as well as from myriad cultural and academic resources. We challenge ourselves to consider the experiences and perspectives of others, engage and promote social justice and create meaningful connections to communities beyond our campus.
By harnessing our abilities as researchers, thinkers and educators, the Dietrich College will embrace difference and celebrate the richness of our diverse culture.

Diversity
We understand and value that every individual is unique. We see this uniqueness shaped by race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, age, physical abilities, religious beliefs, political beliefs and other life experiences and ideologies.

Equity
We are intentional about eliminating barriers that have prevented full participation and are working to increase access to resources and networks for underrepresented groups across our student, faculty and staff populations.

Inclusion
We believe that every person should feel as though they belong here. We are learning how to involve more unique perspectives and actively invite participation from historically underrepresented groups to make our community a better place for all.

The Dietrich College created the DEI Implementation Committee to provide oversight on diversity, equity and inclusion issues and facilitate communication and accountability.


The Dietrich College faculty search committees incorporated procedural changes to minimize bias during searches. In doing so, we are expanding the pool of scholars to recruit to the college. 
As a result, we've hired new faculty members to expand the scope of scholarship in the college on issues like race, racism in medicine, critical race theory and cultural studies.


Carnegie Mellon University has expanded professional development opportunities for staff focused on civility, diversity, equity and inclusion. 
CMU also became a member of Vibrant Pittsburgh to connect staff, faculty and students with resources and events across the greater Pittsburgh area.


The Dietrich College is committed to making our college accessible to low-income, first-generation and/or underrepresented students in Pittsburgh through the LEAP program and the Arts Greenhouse. LEAP is a high school outreach program, in partnership with CFA. This high-quality, intensive year-round program with humanities and arts-focused programming launched in fall 2021. Arts Greenhouse is an arts and humanities education initiative that fosters the expressive and intellectual development of Pittsburgh’s youth.


Dietrich College has welcomed its second cohort for the Dietrich Scholars Fellowship. The Dietrich Scholars Fellowship is an exemplary group of diverse scholars pursuing degrees in the humanities and social sciences. It provides a pathway to success through financial support, opportunities to expand networks and professional development.


Dietrich College is leveraging the new general education curriculum to expand access to courses that cover topics in diversity, equity and inclusion. The new curriculum offers students opportunities to explore courses in intercultural and global inquiry as well as equity and justice. Students can choose from a dozen courses in each category throughout their education at the college.
