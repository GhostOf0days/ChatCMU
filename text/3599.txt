"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."
    – David Conrad, writing on the occasion of Jack Pidgeon's retirement
as Headmaster of the Kiski School,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 25, 2002 


"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to
help students master complex academic material. When teachers demand rigorous
work, students often rise to the occasion, whereas tracking students at
different cognitive levels tends 'diminish learning and boost inequality'."

The Smartest Kids in the World: and how they got that way

Living, shall forfeit fair renown,

To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."
    – Sir Walter Scott, courtesy of Ian Voysey, CS alum, '09


"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!
Reap what you sow, Donald. Time for our national nightmare to end.

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,
on the influence peddling that has created a gold-plated new swamp.
    – New York Times, October 10, 2020

It's destructive, pointless, ineffective, racist, weak, and something the damages of

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."
    – a favorite, always inspiring, passage from Isaiah 50:4-6


"This is wrong on so many levels, I need a whiteboard!"

"A tyrant is a man not having control of himself who attempts to rule others;
a real slave to the greatest fawning; a man who throughout his entire life
... is full of fear."
    – Plato's "Republic"


"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it
hasten peace in that country.  Too often, rash responses to horrific situations are about
the conscience of the attacker rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation."
    – Paul Nuttall, leader of the UK Independence Party (who I never
thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

"Dance your best dance and let others dance theirs.
You cannot manage people for them to create knowledge or innovation.
You must let them dance their best dance to unveil their best potential, and
innovation comes from there."

"What made Nico (A. Nico Habermann, founding Dean of SCS) a great leader?
First, Nico was a man of principles and that was important.
Second, when Nico made a decision, he didn't just tell you the decision;
more importantly, he articulated the priniciples that inevitably led to that
decision."

Rules in the School of Mark Stehlik:
(as told by David Kosbie, May 31, 2012)
(and then reiterated in an
 article in the Fall 2012
issue of "The Link", the CMU SCS newsletter)
1.  Students come first, no matter what.
2.  If you want people to work hard, you have to work harder
3.  Attend to the whole student, not just their mind.

Corollary 1 — Mark's Teaching Axioms:
1.  Be prepared! (do your homework beforehand)
(learning objectives drive assignments drive instructional strategies)
2.  Know your students! (by name)
3.  Be enthusiastic! (about the subject)
4.  Be enthusiastic! (about teaching it)
5.  Be enthusiastic! (about supporting their learning)

Corollary 2 — Mark's Advising Axioms:
1.  Listen effectively
2.  Be welcoming/open
3.  Be non-judgmental/objective
4.  Be honest
5.  Be consistent

"The best way to lead is by example — it is far better to show people
what is expected than to tell them."
    – me


"If you are going to hold those around you to a standard, you have to hold
yourself to a higher standard."
    – me


"It is important to take what you do seriously, but it is equally
important not to take yourself too seriously."
    – me


"Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though
checked by failures...
than to rank with those poorer spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much,
because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat."
    – Teddy Roosevelt


"Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass; it's about learning to dance
in the rain!" 
    – Vivian Greene


"Always do right; this will gratify some people and astonish the rest."
    – Mark Twain


"There is no limit to what a man can achieve as long as he doesn't care who
gets the credit for it."
    – attributed to Charles Edward Montague (and others)


"But the thing that makes a good life isn't constantly being saintly —
it's just continuing to do (stuff).
We spend so much time waiting to start to live."
    – Quinn Norton on the death of Aaron Swartz, quoted in The New Yorker, March 11, 2013


"What makes someone a New Yorker? (posed to comedian Denis Leary):
'If the Popemobile happened to cut you off in traffic and you immediately gave
it the finger, you, my friend, are a New Yorker.'"
    – New York magazine, October 6, 2008


"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work
and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy."
    – Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet: On Work


"Find your passion first, job second."
   – AT&T print advertisement


"Nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion."
    – Georg Friedrich Hegel


"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."
    – Fr. Mychal Judge, FDNY chaplain, rededicating a Bronx firehouse
on 9/10/01,
24 hours before perishing at Ground Zero
from a very moving

biography in the November 12, 2001 issue of New York Magazine


Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",

"When will we again have a President who says, Don't judge me by what I do for
those who have much but for what I can do for those who have little?"
    – William vanden Heuvel speaking about F.D.R. in The New Yorker,

"Gun-control advocates say the answer to gun violence is fewer guns.
Gun-rights advocates say that the answer is more guns: things would have gone
better, they suggest, if the faculty at Columbine, Virginia Tech, and Chardon
High School had been armed. That is the logic of the concealed-carry movement;
that is how armed citizens have come to be patrolling the streets. That is not
how civilians live. When carrying a concealed weapon for self-defense is
understood not as a failure of civil society, to be mourned, but as an act of
citizenship, to be vaunted, there is little civilian life left."
    – from "Battleground America",
an excellent article  by Jill Lepore in The New Yorker, April 23, 2012


"The trouble with so much of the conservative critique of Obama's foreign
policy is that it cares less about outcomes than about the assertion of
America's power and the affirmation of its glory.  In the case of Libya, Obama
led from a place of no glory and, in the eyes of his critics, no results could
ever vindicate such a strategy.  Yet a calculated modesty can augment a
nation's true influence.  Obama would not be the first statesman to realize
that it can be easier to win if you don't need to trumpet your victory."
    – David Remnick editorial, The New Yorker, September 5, 2011


"The damage visited upon America, and upon America's standing in the world, by
the Bush Administration's reckless mis-handling of the public trust will not
easily be undone....

Pollsters like to ask voters which candidate [Bush or Kerry] they'd most like
to have a beer with, and on that metric Bush always wins.  We prefer to ask
which candidate is better suited to the governance of our nation."
    – editorial, The New Yorker, November 1, 2004


"A gangly Illinois politician whom 'the base' would today label a RINO—a
Republican in Name Only—once pointed out that you can fool some of the
people all of the time.  We now know how many 'some' is: twenty-seven per
cent.  That's the proportion of Americans who, according to CNN, cling to the
belief that George W. Bush has done a good job.  The wonder is that this
number is still in the double digits, given the comprehensively disastrous
record.  During the eight years of the second President Bush, the unemployment
rate went from 4.2 per cent to 7.2 per cent and climbing; consumer confidence
dropped to an all-time low; a budget surplus of two hundred billion dollars
became a deficit of that plus a trillion; more than a million families fell
into poverty; the ranks of those without health insurance rose by six million;
and the fruits of the nation's economic growth went almost entirely to the
rich, while family incomes in the middle and below declined.  What role the
Bush Administration's downgrading of terrorism as a foreign-policy priority
played in the success of the 9/11 attacks cannot be known, but there is no
doubting its responsibility for the launching and mismanagement of the
unprovoked war in Iraq, with all its attendant suffering; for allowing the
justified war in Afghanistan to slide to the edge of defeat; and for the
vertiginous worldwide decline of America's influence, prestige, power, and
moral standing."
    – editorial, The New Yorker, January 19, 2009


"The familiar arguments against the death penalty apply to cases like his
[Moussaoui's], some with special force.  Whether or not the prospect of lethal
injection deters ordinary murder—a questionable proposition at
best—it is perverse to imagine that it can deter the sort of murder of
which faith-based ritual suicide is an integral part.  And any execution,
whatever the crime it is intended to punish, degrades the society that decrees
it and demoralizes the particular government employees who are assigned to
carry it out.  A criminal may deserve to die, may deserve even to die in
terror and agony; but no civil servant deserves to be made to participate in
the premeditated killing of another person, however wicked...
The trial and punishment of any international terrorist occurs in a global
political context that darkens another of the stains on capital punishment:
the company it keeps.  In 2005, according to Amnesty International,
ninety-four percent of all known executions took place in four countries.
One, China, is a Communist Party dictatorship.  Two others, Iran and Saudi
Arabia, are Islamist autocracies.  The fourth is the United States."
    – editorial, The New Yorker, May 15, 2006



"What followed was a drama of redemptive, liberating settlement on one side
and catastrophic dispossession on the other—all of it taking place on a
patch of desert land too small for easy division and too imbued with
historical and holy claims for rational negotiation.  For the Jews in
Palestine, Zionism was a movement of national liberation after untold
suffering; for the Arabs, Zionism was an intolerable assault by the colonial
West against sacred ground and Islam itself.  Even now, more than a century
later, politicians and scholars alike quickly betray prejudices, passions, and
allegiances in the details they select when relating the saga that led to the
U.N. Partition Plan, on November 29, 1947, and the war that began just hours
later."

Educational Stuff


 I have been the academic advisor for (almost) all
the students in the Carnegie Mellon
 Computer Science
Undergraduate Program from the inception of the undergraduate program in
1989 until 2012 and then, again, since 2015 when I returned from Qatar.
I will graduate my 3,500th (official) advisee in 2023, including one whose
mother I advised and, in 2025, I will graduate 100 more including three whose
parent(s) I advised!


 As CS undergraduate program director, I am
responsible for all student-side issues in the program.  As a consequence of
my administrative/advising load (all the juniors and seniors (400 students)
in 2021-22, I have not been in the classroom lately.  My most recent teaching
history appears below.


 In 2018-19, I taught
15-110 with David Kosbie.  Tne
previous Spring, I taught 15-121.
Before 121, I taught 15-112 with
David Kosbie many times!

 Prior to that, I
taught 15-121
for three years at our campus in Doha, Qatar when I was Associate Dean for
Education from July, 2012 to December, 2014.

 In Spring, 2008, I was in 
Qatar (!)
at our campus in Doha, teaching the first half of 15-123 to our class of CS
sophomores.  I also taught a mini-semester version of Tom Cortina's successful
Principles of Computation course to the freshmen, numbered
 15-103, as well as a
mini-semester course in Web Apps, 
15-337, to the juniors.


 I have been involved in the Advanced
Placement Computer Science program (I was Chief Reader from 1994 to 1999, when
the transition from Pascal to C++ occurred, only to subesquently move to Java
in 2004).


 I am a co-author of
Karel++: A Gentle
Introduction to the Art of Object-Oriented Programming.  Another of the
co-authors, Joe Bergin, now has a Java-like version of Karel called 

Karel J. Robot.  Check it out!

stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."

"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.
The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through
our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work
and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy."
    – Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet: On Work


"Find your passion first, job second."
   – AT&T print advertisement


"Nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion."
    – Georg Friedrich Hegel


"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

24 hours before perishing at Ground Zero

biography in the November 12, 2001 issue of New York Magazine


Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."

"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;
and I have not rebelled, have not turned back.
I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it
hasten peace in that country.  Too often, rash responses to horrific situations are about
the conscience of the attacker rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation."

thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

decision."

together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."
    – David Conrad, writing on the occasion of Jack Pidgeon's retirement
as Headmaster of the Kiski School,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 25, 2002 


"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to
help students master complex academic material. When teachers demand rigorous
work, students often rise to the occasion, whereas tracking students at
different cognitive levels tends 'diminish learning and boost inequality'."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"Truth prevails, but it's a chore."

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."
    – Sir Walter Scott, courtesy of Ian Voysey, CS alum, '09


"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson


"...to be remembered simply as a good and decent man,

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."

"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to
help students master complex academic material. When teachers demand rigorous
work, students often rise to the occasion, whereas tracking students at
different cognitive levels tends 'diminish learning and boost inequality'."

POLITICS

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

decision."

Why can't we give love that one more chance

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an

"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...

which we're going to have to be dealing with for a very long time."
    – John Oliver at the end of Last Week Tonight's  "Border Wall II" episode, August 23, 2020


And, in the "Trump continues to just make shit up" department...
which, like Pinocchio's nose, has grown so much there are now two separate blogs:
the original, just making shit up, page

and, more specifically, Trump in COVID/BLM-Time

Speaking of...
"Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence
of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president."

A drinking game...
"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."

I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."

as Headmaster of the Kiski School,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 25, 2002 


"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to
help students master complex academic material. When teachers demand rigorous
work, students often rise to the occasion, whereas tracking students at

This is to have succeeded."

POLITICS

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

POLITICS

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

yourself to a higher standard."

important not to take yourself too seriously."

checked by failures...
than to rank with those poorer spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much,
because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat."

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."
    – Fr. Mychal Judge, FDNY chaplain, rededicating a Bronx firehouse
on 9/10/01,
24 hours before perishing at Ground Zero
from a very moving

biography in the November 12, 2001 issue of New York Magazine


Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."
    – David Conrad, writing on the occasion of Jack Pidgeon's retirement
as Headmaster of the Kiski School,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 25, 2002 


"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to
help students master complex academic material. When teachers demand rigorous
work, students often rise to the occasion, whereas tracking students at
different cognitive levels tends 'diminish learning and boost inequality'."

To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;

patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."

as Headmaster of the Kiski School,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 25, 2002 


"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!
Reap what you sow, Donald. Time for our national nightmare to end.

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,
on the influence peddling that has created a gold-plated new swamp.
    – New York Times, October 10, 2020

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."

I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 25, 2002 


"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.
The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through
our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."
    – Sir Walter Scott, courtesy of Ian Voysey, CS alum, '09


"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."
    – David Conrad, writing on the occasion of Jack Pidgeon's retirement
as Headmaster of the Kiski School,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 25, 2002 


"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to
help students master complex academic material. When teachers demand rigorous
work, students often rise to the occasion, whereas tracking students at
different cognitive levels tends 'diminish learning and boost inequality'."

Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;

to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it
hasten peace in that country.  Too often, rash responses to horrific situations are about
the conscience of the attacker rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation."

thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."

"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to
help students master complex academic material. When teachers demand rigorous
work, students often rise to the occasion, whereas tracking students at
different cognitive levels tends 'diminish learning and boost inequality'."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,
because only the toughest can make a life of it.  And that's the key.
Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."
    – David Conrad, writing on the occasion of Jack Pidgeon's retirement
as Headmaster of the Kiski School,
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, May 25, 2002 


"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to
help students master complex academic material. When teachers demand rigorous
work, students often rise to the occasion, whereas tracking students at
different cognitive levels tends 'diminish learning and boost inequality'."

to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"We look at people like Jack Pidgeon or the public school teacher who
stretched the envelope for 30 years as exceptions, as anachronisms,

Teaching's not a job, it's a life.  It's a commitment for life to nurture life.
It should not be so much funded as held sacred.  The fact that we count it as an
expense or that we have to run it like a business is a disgrace."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus

work day."

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"Children succeed in classrooms where they are expected to succeed.
Schools work best when they operate with a clarity of mission: as places to

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The Lord God has given me a well-trained tongue,
that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;

I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."
    – Sir Walter Scott, courtesy of Ian Voysey, CS alum, '09


"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson


"...to be remembered simply as a good and decent man,

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.

which, like Pinocchio's nose, has grown so much there are now two separate blogs:
the original, just making shit up, page

and, more specifically, Trump in COVID/BLM-Time

Speaking of...
"Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence
of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president."
    – Senator Mitt Romney in response to Trump commuting Roger Stone's sentence, July 11, 2020

not even one, who shall be able to judge between his brethren?"

A drinking game...
"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson


"...to be remembered simply as a good and decent man,

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The Lord God has given me a well-trained tongue,
that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;
and I have not rebelled, have not turned back.
I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,

Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.
The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

POLITICS

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

innovation comes from there."

decision."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

POLITICS

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;

I gave my back to those who beat me,

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it

thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

Why can't we give love that one more chance

'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?

And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what

But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."

"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love that one more chance

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson


"...to be remembered simply as a good and decent man,

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false

to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

They shun the light

Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?

And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?

record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!
Reap what you sow, Donald. Time for our national nightmare to end.

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,
on the influence peddling that has created a gold-plated new swamp.
    – New York Times, October 10, 2020
Instead of "draining the swamp", Trump has created a great, strong, beautiful swamp!

which we're going to have to be dealing with for a very long time."

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."

I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Caring about ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?

And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:
more connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.
We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."
    – the final words spoken by Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman (RIP, 8/28/2020)

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.
The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through
our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work
and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy."

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,

To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

checked by failures...
than to rank with those poorer spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much,
because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat."

We spend so much time waiting to start to live."

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",

The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through
our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that
'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge'."

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,

Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."
    – Sir Walter Scott, courtesy of Ian Voysey, CS alum, '09


"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!
Reap what you sow, Donald. Time for our national nightmare to end.

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,

It's destructive, pointless, ineffective, racist, weak, and something the damages of
which we're going to have to be dealing with for a very long time."

A drinking game...
"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

decision."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;

patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;

patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?

And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.

which we're going to have to be dealing with for a very long time."
    – John Oliver at the end of Last Week Tonight's  "Border Wall II" episode, August 23, 2020


And, in the "Trump continues to just make shit up" department...
which, like Pinocchio's nose, has grown so much there are now two separate blogs:
the original, just making shit up, page

and, more specifically, Trump in COVID/BLM-Time

Speaking of...
"Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence
of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president."
    – Senator Mitt Romney in response to Trump commuting Roger Stone's sentence, July 11, 2020

not even one, who shall be able to judge between his brethren?"

A drinking game...
"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero?

And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that

superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:
more connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.
We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.
The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through
our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."
    – Sir Walter Scott, courtesy of Ian Voysey, CS alum, '09


"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty

thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, 'Wow! What a Ride!'"

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.
The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through
our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that
'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge'."

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."
    – Sir Walter Scott, courtesy of Ian Voysey, CS alum, '09


"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,

To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,

To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"What made Nico (A. Nico Habermann, founding Dean of SCS) a great leader?

more importantly, he articulated the priniciples that inevitably led to that
decision."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Or being hated, don't give way to hating,

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

decision."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been.

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,

Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

decision."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,

Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it
hasten peace in that country.  Too often, rash responses to horrific situations are about
the conscience of the attacker rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation."

thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,

To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The Lord God has given me a well-trained tongue,
that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;
and I have not rebelled, have not turned back.
I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it
hasten peace in that country.  Too often, rash responses to horrific situations are about
the conscience of the attacker rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation."

thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,

To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."
    – Ralph Waldo Emerson

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The Lord God has given me a well-trained tongue,
that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;
and I have not rebelled, have not turned back.
I gave my back to those who beat me,

my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,

Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;

my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung."
    – Sir Walter Scott, courtesy of Ian Voysey, CS alum, '09


"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;
and I have not rebelled, have not turned back.
I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"To laugh often and much;
to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false
friends;
to appreciate beauty;
to find the best in others;
to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden
patch or a redeemed social condition;
to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived.
This is to have succeeded."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

POLITICS

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

You must let them dance their best dance to unveil their best potential, and
innovation comes from there."

"What made Nico (A. Nico Habermann, founding Dean of SCS) a great leader?
First, Nico was a man of principles and that was important.
Second, when Nico made a decision, he didn't just tell you the decision;
more importantly, he articulated the priniciples that inevitably led to that
decision."

together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:
more connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.
We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

decision."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:

POLITICS

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

our friends."

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:
more connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.
We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."

I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"We will work to be an example of how we, as brothers and sisters on this earth, should treat each other.
Now, more than ever, the illusions of division threaten our very existence. We all know the truth:
more connects us than separates us. But in times of crisis the wise build bridges, while the foolish build barriers.
We must find a way to look after one another, as if we were one single tribe."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that

superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.

And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the

"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.

a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.

    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?

at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was

Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!
Reap what you sow, Donald. Time for our national nightmare to end.

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,
on the influence peddling that has created a gold-plated new swamp.
    – New York Times, October 10, 2020
Instead of "draining the swamp", Trump has created a great, strong, beautiful swamp!

Just dropped off my ballot at a local election this weekend. I voted for "ByeDon"! You should, too!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

POLITICS

"When a clown moves into a palace, he doesn't become a king. The palace becomes a circus."
    – old Turkish proverb


This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

innovation comes from there."

decision."

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",

This update courtesy of the Jan. 6 insurrection hearings with respect to what
Trump knew and when he knew it, we have this tweet from former Obama AG Eric Holder:

"Trump - 'Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.
This is the smoking gun. Coupled with other testimony demonstrates both Trump's
substantive involvement and corrupt intent, requisite state of mind."
    – Eric Holder tweet, June 23,2022
This is Trump attempting to steal the election, not the other way around!

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!
Reap what you sow, Donald. Time for our national nightmare to end.

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",

And if that isn't enough, there's this:
"What I want to do is this. I just want to find, uh, 11,780 votes,
which is one more than we have, because we won the state."
    – Donald Trump on phone call with GA Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, January 2, 2021
And this is Trump stealing the election!  Guilty as charged!! Why is this difficult to understand?!?

And while the Capital was under seige, Trump did nothing to intervene.  He did,
however, call Rudy Giuliani and various senators about continuing the steal.
"You're the Commander in Chief. You've got an assault going on on the Capitol
of the United states of America. And there's nothing? No call? Nothing? Zero? 
    – General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Trump's deriliction of duty


And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?

Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.

at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that

superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

And these remarks from former Trump acting Deputy AG Richard Donoghue concerning
the replacing acting AG Jeff Rosen with environmental lawyer Jeff Clark on January 3, 2022:

"Mr. President, you're talking about putting a man in that seat who has never tried
a criminal case, who's never conducted a criminal investigation. He's telling you that
he's going to take charge of the department-115,000 employees, including the entire FBI,
and turn the place on a dime and conduct a nationwide criminal investigations that will
produce results in a matter of days? It's impossible. It's absurd. It's not going to happen.
It's going to fail. He has never been in front of a trial jury, a grand jury...
It's not going to happen. He's not competent."


Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

on the influence peddling that has created a gold-plated new swamp.
    – New York Times, October 10, 2020
Instead of "draining the swamp", Trump has created a great, strong, beautiful swamp!

Just dropped off my ballot at a local election this weekend. I voted for "ByeDon"! You should, too!!

And, in the "Trump continues to just make shit up" department...
which, like Pinocchio's nose, has grown so much there are now two separate blogs:
the original, just making shit up, page

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",
an excellent article by Atul Gawande, M.D. in The New Yorker, August 2, 2010



Trump, being ever-so-presidential, concerning "waiving" executive privilege for Steve Bannon,
"When you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked
Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated,
having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be
going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President.

Therefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive
Executive Privilege for you, which allows for you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly,
as per the request of the Unselect Committee of political Thugs and Hacks, who have allowed
no Due Process, no Cross-Examination, and no real Republican members or witnesses to be present
or interviewed. It is a partisan Kangaroo Court.

Why should these evil, sinister, and unpatriotic people be allowed to hurt and destroy
the lives of so many, and cause such great harm to our Country?
Because, you jackass, you are the one continuing to cause great harm to this country!


Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.

Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

Time for another update, this time from retired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman: 

Sharp-elbowed politics is not against the law, nor should it be. It has always been
fair game to criticize public figures. But what happened to me was something different.
I was attacked in a way calculated to inflict maximum personal and professional damage
likely in order to prevent me from testifying or to punish me for doing so. In this country,
that violates the law...
My lawsuit isn't meant to relitigate Trump's conduct with respect to Ukraine or
the merits of his impeachment. But the impeachment process is the primary tool our
Constitution provides for holding our chief executive accountable outside of elections,
and Trump tried to obstruct that process. While the impeachment proceedings are
over and done with, the broader harm to our democracy has not been redressed, and
the lasting threat to other government officials who want to do the right thing remains today.
    – Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (ret.) in an op-ed concerning his lawsuit against Trump, etal., February 2, 2022


I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."

I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

I haven't made an entry here in almost a year, but the Jan. 6 Insurrection
hearing compels comment.

"Once all the committee members had made their statements, then it was time for the
police officers to have their say. They said dozens of things that got a lot of play
on social media, news broadcasts, websites, etc. Here are some of the most notable:
Daniel Hodges:
"To my perpetual confusion, I saw the thin blue line flag,
a symbol of support for law enforcement, more than once being carried by the

terrorists as they ignored our commands and continued to assault us."
Aquilino Gonell:
"There was nobody else. It was not Antifa, or Black Lives Matter, or the FBI.
It was [Donald Trump's] supporters that he sent over to the Capitol that day ...
He talks about sacrificing ... and the only thing he sacrificed was the institutions
of the country, and the country itself, only for his ego ... The rioters called me traitor,
a disgrace, and shouted that I, an Army veteran and a police officer, should be executed."
Harry Dunn:
"Then the crowd, perhaps around 20 people, joined in, screaming 'Boo! Fucking n*****!' ...
And as Black officers, I believe we fought a different battle also, and the fact that we had
our race attacked and just because of the way we look, you know, to answer your question,
frankly, I guess it is America. It shouldn't be, but I guess that's the way things are."
Michael Fanone:
"My law enforcement career prepared me to cope with some of the aspects of this experience.
Nothing has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue
to deny the events of that day, and in doing so, betray their oath of office."
    – electoral-vote.com, July 28, 2021

The Washington Post adds this comment from Officer Fanone:
"So many of the people I put my life at risk to defend are downplaying or outright denying what
happened. I feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room.
But too many are now telling me that hell doesn't exist or that hell actually wasn't that bad."
    – what have we become as a nation for this to be true?


"We may be turning a corner with this virus, but the corner we turned is down a dark alley of
record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!
Reap what you sow, Donald. Time for our national nightmare to end.

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,
on the influence peddling that has created a gold-plated new swamp.
    – New York Times, October 10, 2020

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."

I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

record infections and deaths. Mr. Trump is a self-proclaimed expert on a wide variety of topics,
but when pushed on basic topics he doesn't want to discuss, he very quickly feigns ignorance.
...
Since Trump took over, the national debt has exploded by more than 7 TRILLION dollars.
While the last several trillion was in response to the COVID-19 economic crisis,
at least the first three trillion was on the books well before the pandemic, while Trump was
presiding over '...the best economy we've ever had in the history of our country.' (Trump's words.)
...
Donald Trump did not create the social-media-driven political landscape we now live in,
but he has weaponized it. He is a consummate linguistic takedown artist, ripping apart all comers
to the delight of his fanbase but at the expense of the nation. America faces many challenges
and needs a president to build this country up. This appears to be outside of Mr. Trump's skill set.
...
President Trump is not always 100 percent wrong, but he is 100 percent wrong for America.
    – NH Union Leader editorial, October 25, 2020
The Union Leader has not endorsed a Democatic presidential candidate in over 100 years!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you

want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for

The New York Times reports, in the context of the Trump tax return scandal,
on the influence peddling that has created a gold-plated new swamp.
    – New York Times, October 10, 2020
Instead of "draining the swamp", Trump has created a great, strong, beautiful swamp!

Just dropped off my ballot at a local election this weekend. I voted for "ByeDon"! You should, too!!


"All Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. All he thinks about is the stock market."
    – Joe Biden during CNN drive-in town hall, September 17, 2020
Bazinga!

"Remember: every example of violence Donald Trump decries has happened on his watch.
Under his leadership. During his presidency.
    – Joe Biden tweet, August 28, 2020
Bazinga!

"The Trump re-election strategy seems to be to argue that only Donald Trump
can save America from Donald Trump's America."
    – Dan Rather tweet, August 27, 2020


"There's perhaps nothing more emblematic of his presidency than this wall.
It's destructive, pointless, ineffective, racist, weak, and something the damages of
which we're going to have to be dealing with for a very long time."
    – John Oliver at the end of Last Week Tonight's  "Border Wall II" episode, August 23, 2020


And, in the "Trump continues to just make shit up" department...
which, like Pinocchio's nose, has grown so much there are now two separate blogs:
the original, just making shit up, page

and, more specifically, Trump in COVID/BLM-Time

Speaking of...
"Unprecedented, historic corruption: an American president commutes the sentence
of a person convicted by a jury of lying to shield that very president."
    – Senator Mitt Romney in response to Trump commuting Roger Stone's sentence, July 11, 2020
Meet the new swamp, the gold-plated new swamp!

"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you,
not even one, who shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
    – 1 Corinthians 6:5
I guess there is one such wise man...

A drinking game...
"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."
    – the conclusion of Andrew Cuomo's daily briefing, 3/24/2020


"The highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy,
but a love of one's country deep enough to call her to a higher standard."
    – George McGovern


"The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their
neutrality in times of moral crisis."
    – John F. Kennedy, quoting (not accurately) Dante's "Inferno"


"What we ignore, we empower."

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward

    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus

Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

And, in the "Trump continues to just make shit up" department...
which, like Pinocchio's nose, has grown so much there are now two separate blogs:
the original, just making shit up, page

and, more specifically, Trump in COVID/BLM-Time

Speaking of...

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."

I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

And, in the "Trump continues to just make shit up" department...
which, like Pinocchio's nose, has grown so much there are now two separate blogs:

and, more specifically, Trump in COVID/BLM-Time

"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

on 9/10/01,
24 hours before perishing at Ground Zero
from a very moving

biography in the November 12, 2001 issue of New York Magazine


Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

And, in the "Trump continues to just make shit up" department...
which, like Pinocchio's nose, has grown so much there are now two separate blogs:
the original, just making shit up, page

and, more specifically, Trump in COVID/BLM-Time

Speaking of...

A drinking game...
"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

important not to take yourself too seriously."

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus

Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",

"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you,
not even one, who shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
    – 1 Corinthians 6:5
I guess there is one such wise man...

A drinking game...
"I want to thank President Trump for his (outstanding) leadership and support."
    – said by every Trump lackey at every briefing, always
I think it should be a drinking game!  One shot each for mention;
guaranteed you won't make it to the end of the briefing without passing out!!

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."
    – the conclusion of Andrew Cuomo's daily briefing, 3/24/2020

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

"I woke up today, I was crying
Lost in a lost world
'Cause so many people are dying
Lost in a lost world

Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",
an excellent article by Atul Gawande, M.D. in The New Yorker, August 2, 2010



Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes it's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves

They shun the light
They think they're right
Living in their empty shells!

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"
    – lyrics to "Lost in a Lost World" by The Moody Blues, 1972


Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...

And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus

Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Oh, can you see their world is crashing
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Are telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill

Grow the seeds of evolution
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons!
(so many people, so many people)

Everywhere you go you see them searching
Everywhere you turn you feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
Well, look again
Come on my friend
Love will find them in the end!"

Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American
portrayed in that iconic anti-pollution PSA from the 70's.
I am shedding tears for what my country has become.
    – me, 3/4/2020


And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

life?",

Listening to NPR this morning, I felt like the Native American

I am shedding tears for what my country has become.

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

And then, not 3 weeks later, a reminder that the heart of this country still
beats in my hometown:

"And we're going to get through it because we are New York, and because we've
dealt with a lot of things, and because we are smart. You have to be smart to
make it in New York. And we are resourceful, and we are showing how resourceful
we are. And because we are united, and when you are united, there is nothing
you can't do. And because we are New York tough. We are tough. You have to be
tough. This place makes you tough. But it makes you tough in a good way. We're
going to make it because I love New York, and I love New York because New York loves you.


New York loves all of you. Black and white and brown and Asian and short and
tall and gay and straight. New York loves everyone. That's why I love New
York. It always has, it always will. And at the end of the day, my friends,
even if it is a long day, and this is a long day, love wins. Always. And it
will win again through this virus. Thank you."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

decision."

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"It is important to take what you do seriously, but it is equally
important not to take yourself too seriously."

together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"

day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,

quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

Caring about ourselves

God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you

biography in the November 12, 2001 issue of New York Magazine


Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",
an excellent article by Atul Gawande, M.D. in The New Yorker, August 2, 2010



"Edge cases are always important: in programming; in life."
    – me
"But, you don't make policies around edge cases;
you make policies for the nominal case and deal with the edge cases as the
exceptions they are."
    – me


"Show me how you drive, and I'll tell you who you are."
    – Vin Diesel (as Dom Toretto) in Fast & Furious 6


"A good exit is a quick one."
    – Geoffrey Hitch, lecturing in Business Acting II, June, 2013


"The Lord God has given me a well-trained tongue,
that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;
and I have not rebelled, have not turned back.
I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."
    – a favorite, always inspiring, passage from Isaiah 50:4-6


"This is wrong on so many levels, I need a whiteboard!"
    – anonymous


"A tyrant is a man not having control of himself who attempts to rule others;
a real slave to the greatest fawning; a man who throughout his entire life
... is full of fear."
    – Plato's "Republic"


"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it
hasten peace in that country.  Too often, rash responses to horrific situations are about
the conscience of the attacker rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation."
    – Paul Nuttall, leader of the UK Independence Party (who I never
thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

"It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do;
we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do."
    – Steve Jobs


"Dance your best dance and let others dance theirs.
You cannot manage people for them to create knowledge or innovation.
You must let them dance their best dance to unveil their best potential, and
innovation comes from there."
    – Eva Chen, Trend Micro CEO, quoted in a CNN interview


"What made Nico (A. Nico Habermann, founding Dean of SCS) a great leader?
First, Nico was a man of principles and that was important.
Second, when Nico made a decision, he didn't just tell you the decision;
more importantly, he articulated the priniciples that inevitably led to that
decision."
    – Tom Mitchell, CMU Machine Learning Professor, giving the Habermann Lecture
at CMU-Q, February 4, 2014

what is expected than to tell them."

"If you are going to hold those around you to a standard, you have to hold
yourself to a higher standard."
    – me


"It is important to take what you do seriously, but it is equally
important not to take yourself too seriously."
    – me

because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat."
    – Teddy Roosevelt

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction."
    – Antoine de Saint-Exupery


"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work
and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy."

"Find your passion first, job second."
   – AT&T print advertisement


"Nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion."

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work
and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy."
    – Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet: On Work


"Find your passion first, job second."
   – AT&T print advertisement


"Nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion."
    – Georg Friedrich Hegel


"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."
    – Fr. Mychal Judge, FDNY chaplain, rededicating a Bronx firehouse
on 9/10/01,
24 hours before perishing at Ground Zero
from a very moving

biography in the November 12, 2001 issue of New York Magazine


Of particular relevance as my parents entered their
eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."
    – from "Letting Go: What should medicine do when it can't save your
life?",
an excellent article by Atul Gawande, M.D. in The New Yorker, August 2, 2010



"The Lord God has given me a well-trained tongue,
that I might know how to speak to the weary a word that will rouse them.
Morning after morning he opens my ear that I may hear;
and I have not rebelled, have not turned back.
I gave my back to those who beat me,
my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
my face I did not shield from buffets and spitting."
    – a favorite, always inspiring, passage from Isaiah 50:4-6

"A tyrant is a man not having control of himself who attempts to rule others;
a real slave to the greatest fawning; a man who throughout his entire life
... is full of fear."
    – Plato's "Republic"


"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it
hasten peace in that country.  Too often, rash responses to horrific situations are about
the conscience of the attacker rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation."
    – Paul Nuttall, leader of the UK Independence Party (who I never
thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."
    – "If—" by Rudyard Kipling

we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do."

"Dance your best dance and let others dance theirs.
You cannot manage people for them to create knowledge or innovation.
You must let them dance their best dance to unveil their best potential, and
innovation comes from there."

"What made Nico (A. Nico Habermann, founding Dean of SCS) a great leader?
First, Nico was a man of principles and that was important.

more importantly, he articulated the priniciples that inevitably led to that
decision."

Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"The whole world rightly condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria,
but the US attack on the Assad regime does nothing to lower tensions, nor will it
hasten peace in that country.  Too often, rash responses to horrific situations are about
the conscience of the attacker rather than a clear-headed response to an awful situation."

thought I would ever agree with!), 4/7/2017


"The problem with free speech is that it's hard, and self-censorship is the
path of least resistance.
But, once you learn to keep yourself from voicing unwelcome thoughts,
you forget how to think them — how to think freely at all — and ideas perish at conception."
    – George Packer on the murders of Washiqur Rahman and Avijit Roy,
quoted in The New Yorker, April 13, 2015


"If you can keep your head when all about you
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
  But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
  Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
  And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
  And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken
  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
  And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
  And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
  To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
  Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
  Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
  If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
  And—which is more—you'll be a Man, my son."

want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who

Caring about ourselves

Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus
on a Saturday afternoon):
"Herb, what are you doing on campus?  Today's not a work 
day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work
and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy."

"Nothing great in the world has been accomplished without passion."

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

eighties (God rest their souls)...
"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward
together in the same direction."

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word

The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves

day."
Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only distaste,
it is better that you should leave your work

called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"True love does not consist in gazing at each other, but in looking outward

"Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more chance
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love...
'Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance...
This is ourselves
Under pressure"
    – from "Under Pressure" by David Bowie & Queen, 1981


Me (to Herb Simon, Nobel Prize winner, as we walked toward each other on campus

Herb (to me): "If you love what you do, every day's a 
work day."
What a wonderful motto!

"Good days, bad days, but never a boring day on this job.  You do what God has
called you to do.  You show up, you put one foot in front of the other, and
you do your job, which is a mystery and a surprise.  You have no idea...what
God is calling you to.  But he needs you, so keep going.  Keep
supporting each other.  Be kind to each other.  Love each other.  Work
together.  You love the job.  We all do.  What a blessing that is."

"The simple view is that medicine exists to fight death and disease, and that
is, of course, its most basic task.  Death is the enemy.  But the enemy has
superior forces.  Eventually it wins.  And, in a war that you cannot win, you
don't want a general who fights to the point of total annihilation.  You don't
want Custer.  You want Robert E. Lee, someone who knew how to fight for
territory when he could and how to surrender when he couldn't, someone who
understood that the damage is greatest if all you do is fight to the bitter
end."

"When will we again have a President who says, Don't judge me by what I do for

"Gun-control advocates say the answer to gun violence is fewer guns.
Gun-rights advocates say that the answer is more guns: things would have gone
better, they suggest, if the faculty at Columbine, Virginia Tech, and Chardon
High School had been armed. That is the logic of the concealed-carry movement;
that is how armed citizens have come to be patrolling the streets. That is not
how civilians live. When carrying a concealed weapon for self-defense is
understood not as a failure of civil society, to be mourned, but as an act of
citizenship, to be vaunted, there is little civilian life left."
    – from "Battleground America",
an excellent article  by Jill Lepore in The New Yorker, April 23, 2012


"The trouble with so much of the conservative critique of Obama's foreign
policy is that it cares less about outcomes than about the assertion of
America's power and the affirmation of its glory.  In the case of Libya, Obama
led from a place of no glory and, in the eyes of his critics, no results could
ever vindicate such a strategy.  Yet a calculated modesty can augment a
nation's true influence.  Obama would not be the first statesman to realize
that it can be easier to win if you don't need to trumpet your victory."
    – David Remnick editorial, The New Yorker, September 5, 2011


"The damage visited upon America, and upon America's standing in the world, by
the Bush Administration's reckless mis-handling of the public trust will not
easily be undone....

Pollsters like to ask voters which candidate [Bush or Kerry] they'd most like
to have a beer with, and on that metric Bush always wins.  We prefer to ask
which candidate is better suited to the governance of our nation."
    – editorial, The New Yorker, November 1, 2004


"A gangly Illinois politician whom 'the base' would today label a RINO—a
Republican in Name Only—once pointed out that you can fool some of the
people all of the time.  We now know how many 'some' is: twenty-seven per
cent.  That's the proportion of Americans who, according to CNN, cling to the
belief that George W. Bush has done a good job.  The wonder is that this
number is still in the double digits, given the comprehensively disastrous
record.  During the eight years of the second President Bush, the unemployment
rate went from 4.2 per cent to 7.2 per cent and climbing; consumer confidence
dropped to an all-time low; a budget surplus of two hundred billion dollars
became a deficit of that plus a trillion; more than a million families fell
into poverty; the ranks of those without health insurance rose by six million;
and the fruits of the nation's economic growth went almost entirely to the
rich, while family incomes in the middle and below declined.  What role the
Bush Administration's downgrading of terrorism as a foreign-policy priority
played in the success of the 9/11 attacks cannot be known, but there is no
doubting its responsibility for the launching and mismanagement of the
unprovoked war in Iraq, with all its attendant suffering; for allowing the
justified war in Afghanistan to slide to the edge of defeat; and for the
vertiginous worldwide decline of America's influence, prestige, power, and
moral standing."
    – editorial, The New Yorker, January 19, 2009


"The familiar arguments against the death penalty apply to cases like his
[Moussaoui's], some with special force.  Whether or not the prospect of lethal
injection deters ordinary murder—a questionable proposition at
best—it is perverse to imagine that it can deter the sort of murder of
which faith-based ritual suicide is an integral part.  And any execution,
whatever the crime it is intended to punish, degrades the society that decrees
it and demoralizes the particular government employees who are assigned to
carry it out.  A criminal may deserve to die, may deserve even to die in
terror and agony; but no civil servant deserves to be made to participate in
the premeditated killing of another person, however wicked...
The trial and punishment of any international terrorist occurs in a global
political context that darkens another of the stains on capital punishment:
the company it keeps.  In 2005, according to Amnesty International,
ninety-four percent of all known executions took place in four countries.
One, China, is a Communist Party dictatorship.  Two others, Iran and Saudi
Arabia, are Islamist autocracies.  The fourth is the United States."
    – editorial, The New Yorker, May 15, 2006



"What followed was a drama of redemptive, liberating settlement on one side
and catastrophic dispossession on the other—all of it taking place on a
patch of desert land too small for easy division and too imbued with
historical and holy claims for rational negotiation.  For the Jews in
Palestine, Zionism was a movement of national liberation after untold
suffering; for the Arabs, Zionism was an intolerable assault by the colonial
West against sacred ground and Islam itself.  Even now, more than a century
later, politicians and scholars alike quickly betray prejudices, passions, and
allegiances in the details they select when relating the saga that led to the
U.N. Partition Plan, on November 29, 1947, and the war that began just hours
later."

Educational Stuff


 I have been the academic advisor for (almost) all
the students in the Carnegie Mellon
 Computer Science
Undergraduate Program from the inception of the undergraduate program in
1989 until 2012 and then, again, since 2015 when I returned from Qatar.
I will graduate my 3,500th (official) advisee in 2023, including one whose
mother I advised and, in 2025, I will graduate 100 more including three whose
parent(s) I advised!


 As CS undergraduate program director, I am
responsible for all student-side issues in the program.  As a consequence of
my administrative/advising load (all the juniors and seniors (400 students)
in 2021-22, I have not been in the classroom lately.  My most recent teaching
history appears below.


 In 2018-19, I taught
15-110 with David Kosbie.  Tne
previous Spring, I taught 15-121.
Before 121, I taught 15-112 with
David Kosbie many times!

 Prior to that, I
taught 15-121
for three years at our campus in Doha, Qatar when I was Associate Dean for
Education from July, 2012 to December, 2014.

 In Spring, 2008, I was in 
Qatar (!)
at our campus in Doha, teaching the first half of 15-123 to our class of CS
sophomores.  I also taught a mini-semester version of Tom Cortina's successful
Principles of Computation course to the freshmen, numbered
 15-103, as well as a
mini-semester course in Web Apps, 
15-337, to the juniors.


 I have been involved in the Advanced
Placement Computer Science program (I was Chief Reader from 1994 to 1999, when
the transition from Pascal to C++ occurred, only to subesquently move to Java
in 2004).


 I am a co-author of
Karel++: A Gentle
Introduction to the Art of Object-Oriented Programming.  Another of the
co-authors, Joe Bergin, now has a Java-like version of Karel called 

Karel J. Robot.  Check it out!

OLDER POLITICS

"If you're not TOTALLY APPALLED, you're not paying attention!"
    – bumper sticker (a wonderful motto for these past 
    four eight years [to be clear, the years in question
    are 2000-2008])

"When will we again have a President who says, Don't judge me by what I do for
those who have much but for what I can do for those who have little?"
    – William vanden Heuvel speaking about F.D.R. in The New Yorker,
August 15 & 22, 2011


"Gun-control advocates say the answer to gun violence is fewer guns.
Gun-rights advocates say that the answer is more guns: things would have gone
better, they suggest, if the faculty at Columbine, Virginia Tech, and Chardon
High School had been armed. That is the logic of the concealed-carry movement;
that is how armed citizens have come to be patrolling the streets. That is not
how civilians live. When carrying a concealed weapon for self-defense is
understood not as a failure of civil society, to be mourned, but as an act of
citizenship, to be vaunted, there is little civilian life left."
    – from "Battleground America",
an excellent article  by Jill Lepore in The New Yorker, April 23, 2012


"The trouble with so much of the conservative critique of Obama's foreign
policy is that it cares less about outcomes than about the assertion of
America's power and the affirmation of its glory.  In the case of Libya, Obama
led from a place of no glory and, in the eyes of his critics, no results could
ever vindicate such a strategy.  Yet a calculated modesty can augment a
nation's true influence.  Obama would not be the first statesman to realize
that it can be easier to win if you don't need to trumpet your victory."
    – David Remnick editorial, The New Yorker, September 5, 2011


"The damage visited upon America, and upon America's standing in the world, by
the Bush Administration's reckless mis-handling of the public trust will not
easily be undone....

Pollsters like to ask voters which candidate [Bush or Kerry] they'd most like
to have a beer with, and on that metric Bush always wins.  We prefer to ask
which candidate is better suited to the governance of our nation."
    – editorial, The New Yorker, November 1, 2004


"A gangly Illinois politician whom 'the base' would today label a RINO—a
Republican in Name Only—once pointed out that you can fool some of the
people all of the time.  We now know how many 'some' is: twenty-seven per
cent.  That's the proportion of Americans who, according to CNN, cling to the
belief that George W. Bush has done a good job.  The wonder is that this
number is still in the double digits, given the comprehensively disastrous
record.  During the eight years of the second President Bush, the unemployment
rate went from 4.2 per cent to 7.2 per cent and climbing; consumer confidence
dropped to an all-time low; a budget surplus of two hundred billion dollars
became a deficit of that plus a trillion; more than a million families fell
into poverty; the ranks of those without health insurance rose by six million;
and the fruits of the nation's economic growth went almost entirely to the
rich, while family incomes in the middle and below declined.  What role the
Bush Administration's downgrading of terrorism as a foreign-policy priority
played in the success of the 9/11 attacks cannot be known, but there is no
doubting its responsibility for the launching and mismanagement of the
unprovoked war in Iraq, with all its attendant suffering; for allowing the
justified war in Afghanistan to slide to the edge of defeat; and for the
vertiginous worldwide decline of America's influence, prestige, power, and
moral standing."
    – editorial, The New Yorker, January 19, 2009


"The familiar arguments against the death penalty apply to cases like his
[Moussaoui's], some with special force.  Whether or not the prospect of lethal
injection deters ordinary murder—a questionable proposition at
best—it is perverse to imagine that it can deter the sort of murder of
which faith-based ritual suicide is an integral part.  And any execution,
whatever the crime it is intended to punish, degrades the society that decrees
it and demoralizes the particular government employees who are assigned to
carry it out.  A criminal may deserve to die, may deserve even to die in
terror and agony; but no civil servant deserves to be made to participate in
the premeditated killing of another person, however wicked...
The trial and punishment of any international terrorist occurs in a global
political context that darkens another of the stains on capital punishment:
the company it keeps.  In 2005, according to Amnesty International,
ninety-four percent of all known executions took place in four countries.
One, China, is a Communist Party dictatorship.  Two others, Iran and Saudi
Arabia, are Islamist autocracies.  The fourth is the United States."

became a deficit of that plus a trillion; more than a million families fell
into poverty; the ranks of those without health insurance rose by six million;
and the fruits of the nation's economic growth went almost entirely to the
rich, while family incomes in the middle and below declined.  What role the
Bush Administration's downgrading of terrorism as a foreign-policy priority
played in the success of the 9/11 attacks cannot be known, but there is no
doubting its responsibility for the launching and mismanagement of the
unprovoked war in Iraq, with all its attendant suffering; for allowing the
justified war in Afghanistan to slide to the edge of defeat; and for the
vertiginous worldwide decline of America's influence, prestige, power, and
moral standing."

"The familiar arguments against the death penalty apply to cases like his
[Moussaoui's], some with special force.  Whether or not the prospect of lethal
injection deters ordinary murder—a questionable proposition at
best—it is perverse to imagine that it can deter the sort of murder of
which faith-based ritual suicide is an integral part.  And any execution,
whatever the crime it is intended to punish, degrades the society that decrees
it and demoralizes the particular government employees who are assigned to
carry it out.  A criminal may deserve to die, may deserve even to die in
terror and agony; but no civil servant deserves to be made to participate in
the premeditated killing of another person, however wicked...
The trial and punishment of any international terrorist occurs in a global
political context that darkens another of the stains on capital punishment:
the company it keeps.  In 2005, according to Amnesty International,
ninety-four percent of all known executions took place in four countries.
One, China, is a Communist Party dictatorship.  Two others, Iran and Saudi
Arabia, are Islamist autocracies.  The fourth is the United States."

"What followed was a drama of redemptive, liberating settlement on one side
and catastrophic dispossession on the other—all of it taking place on a
patch of desert land too small for easy division and too imbued with
historical and holy claims for rational negotiation.  For the Jews in
Palestine, Zionism was a movement of national liberation after untold
suffering; for the Arabs, Zionism was an intolerable assault by the colonial
West against sacred ground and Islam itself.  Even now, more than a century
later, politicians and scholars alike quickly betray prejudices, passions, and
allegiances in the details they select when relating the saga that led to the
U.N. Partition Plan, on November 29, 1947, and the war that began just hours
later."

"The trouble with so much of the conservative critique of Obama's foreign
policy is that it cares less about outcomes than about the assertion of
America's power and the affirmation of its glory.  In the case of Libya, Obama
led from a place of no glory and, in the eyes of his critics, no results could
ever vindicate such a strategy.  Yet a calculated modesty can augment a
nation's true influence.  Obama would not be the first statesman to realize
that it can be easier to win if you don't need to trumpet your victory."

"The damage visited upon America, and upon America's standing in the world, by
the Bush Administration's reckless mis-handling of the public trust will not
easily be undone....

Pollsters like to ask voters which candidate [Bush or Kerry] they'd most like
to have a beer with, and on that metric Bush always wins.  We prefer to ask
which candidate is better suited to the governance of our nation."

people all of the time.  We now know how many 'some' is: twenty-seven per

belief that George W. Bush has done a good job.  The wonder is that this
number is still in the double digits, given the comprehensively disastrous
record.  During the eight years of the second President Bush, the unemployment

Mark in a kilt! The result of "winning" an April, 1998 Lambda Sigma
(sophomore honor society) "vote-to-see-a-faculty-member-in-a-kilt" fundraiser
for the American Cancer Society.  For the latest in commencement fashion,
check out the full-color Commencement kilts!

 All this kilt wearing has sparked a trend in
costumed faculty.  Check out Klaus Sutner in Fall,
1999!


 Even President Cohon
has gotten into the act in Spring, 2002 (due, in large part, to some
concerted ballot-stuffing on the part of costumed-out CS faculty)!

Educational Stuff


 I have been the academic advisor for (almost) all
the students in the Carnegie Mellon
 Computer Science
Undergraduate Program from the inception of the undergraduate program in
1989 until 2012 and then, again, since 2015 when I returned from Qatar.
I will graduate my 3,500th (official) advisee in 2023, including one whose
mother I advised and, in 2025, I will graduate 100 more including three whose
parent(s) I advised!


 As CS undergraduate program director, I am
responsible for all student-side issues in the program.  As a consequence of
my administrative/advising load (all the juniors and seniors (400 students)
in 2021-22, I have not been in the classroom lately.  My most recent teaching
history appears below.


 In 2018-19, I taught
15-110 with David Kosbie.  Tne
previous Spring, I taught 15-121.
Before 121, I taught 15-112 with
David Kosbie many times!

 Prior to that, I
taught 15-121
for three years at our campus in Doha, Qatar when I was Associate Dean for
Education from July, 2012 to December, 2014.

 In Spring, 2008, I was in 
Qatar (!)
at our campus in Doha, teaching the first half of 15-123 to our class of CS
sophomores.  I also taught a mini-semester version of Tom Cortina's successful
Principles of Computation course to the freshmen, numbered
 15-103, as well as a
mini-semester course in Web Apps, 
15-337, to the juniors.


 I have been involved in the Advanced
Placement Computer Science program (I was Chief Reader from 1994 to 1999, when
the transition from Pascal to C++ occurred, only to subesquently move to Java
in 2004).


 I am a co-author of
Karel++: A Gentle
Introduction to the Art of Object-Oriented Programming.  Another of the
co-authors, Joe Bergin, now has a Java-like version of Karel called 

Karel J. Robot.  Check it out!

at our campus in Doha, teaching the first half of 15-123 to our class of CS
sophomores.  I also taught a mini-semester version of Tom Cortina's successful
Principles of Computation course to the freshmen, numbered
 15-103, as well as a
mini-semester course in Web Apps, 
15-337, to the juniors.


 I have been involved in the Advanced
Placement Computer Science program (I was Chief Reader from 1994 to 1999, when
the transition from Pascal to C++ occurred, only to subesquently move to Java
in 2004).


 I am a co-author of
Karel++: A Gentle
Introduction to the Art of Object-Oriented Programming.  Another of the
co-authors, Joe Bergin, now has a Java-like version of Karel called 

Karel J. Robot.  Check it out!
