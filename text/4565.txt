June 5, 2023



ReLM enables writing tests that are guaranteed to come from the set of valid strings, such as dates. Without ReLM, LLMs are free to complete prompts with non-date answers, which are difficult to assess. TL;DR: While large language models (LLMs)…

On Privacy and Personalization in Federated Learning: A Retrospective on the US/UK PETs Challenge










May 12, 2023



TL;DR: We study the use of differential privacy in personalized, cross-silo federated learning (NeurIPS’22), explain how these insights led us to develop a 1st place solution in the US/UK Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) Prize Challenge, and share challenges and lessons learned…

TIDEE: An Embodied Agent that Tidies Up Novel Rooms using Commonsense Priors










April 14, 2023



Example of embodied commonsense reasoning. A robot proactively identifies a remote on the floor and knows it is out of place without instruction. Then, the robot figures out where to place it in the scene and manipulates it there. For…

Are Model Explanations Useful in Practice? Rethinking How to Support Human-ML Interactions.










March 31, 2023



Figure 1. This blog post discusses the effectiveness of black-box model explanations in aiding end users to make decisions. We observe that explanations do not in fact help with concrete applications such as fraud detection and paper matching for peer…

RLPrompt: Optimizing Discrete Text Prompts with Reinforcement Learning










February 24, 2023



Figure 1: Overview of RL Prompt for discrete prompt optimization. All language models (LMs) are frozen. We build our policy network by training a task-specific multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network inserted into a frozen pre-trained LM. The figure above illustrates 1)…

Bottom-up Top-Down Detection Transformers For Open Vocabulary Object Detection










January 13, 2023



We perform open vocabulary detection of the objects mentioned in the sentence using both bottom-up and top-down feedback. Object detection is the fundamental computer vision task of finding all “objects” that are present in a visual scene. However, this raises…

Causal Confounds in Sequential Decision Making










November 28, 2022



A standard assumption in sequential decision making is that we observe everything required to make good decisions. In practice however, this isn’t always the case. We discuss two specific examples (temporally correlated noise (a) and unobserved contexts (c)) that have…

Navigating to Objects in the Real World

 / 
June 30, 2023


Empirical study: We evaluated three approaches for robots to navigate to objects in six visually diverse homes. TLDR: Semantic navigation is necessary to deploy mobile robots in uncontrolled environments like our homes, schools, and hospitals. Many learning-based approaches have been proposed in response to the lack of semantic understanding of the classical pipeline for spatial navigation. But learned visual navigation policies have predominantly been evaluated in simulation. How well do different classes of methods work on a robot? We present…
