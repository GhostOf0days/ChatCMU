Suppose you are thinking about graduate study in a computer science discipline*. In that case, you should join us for an informal Q&A discussion about whatever aspect of grad study you’d like to learn more about.Curious about what software engineering research looks like? We’d love to tell you! Need advice on navigating the absurd number of grad programs at CMU? We got you. Do you want to know how we’re using computing to tackle massive social issues? Strap in! Need an opinion on your application materials? We’d love to take a look (time permitting, of course).So take a look through the sessions below and register today!

S3D Grad School Q&A Sessions
Suppose you are thinking about graduate study in a computer science discipline*. In that case, you should join us for an informal Q&A discussion about whatever aspect of grad study you’d like to learn more about.
Curious about what software engineering research looks like? We’d love to tell you! Need advice on navigating the absurd number of grad programs at CMU? We got you. Do you want to know how we’re using computing to tackle massive social issues? Strap in! Need an opinion on your application materials? We’d love to take a look (time permitting, of course).
So take a look through the sessions below and register today! (Yes, registration is required.) 
Please note: All times listed below are in Eastern Standard Time.


 
*It’s important to note that computer science at CMU isn’t a department within a larger college. We are an entire college (although we call ourselves the “School of Computer Science”). While we are close to our colleagues across the college - and know a good bit about who is interested in what - our department has its own specialties that we are well-positioned to discuss (namely Software Engineering and Societal Computing). If you are explicitly interested in another department - such as Machine Learning or Robotics, for example - we want you to know that you are still welcome to attend any of these sessions. Just understand that we may not be able to answer your questions as well as someone within those disciplines.

S3D Grad School Q&A Sessions
Suppose you are thinking about graduate study in a computer science discipline*. In that case, you should join us for an informal Q&A discussion about whatever aspect of grad study you’d like to learn more about.
Curious about what software engineering research looks like? We’d love to tell you! Need advice on navigating the absurd number of grad programs at CMU? We got you. Do you want to know how we’re using computing to tackle massive social issues? Strap in! Need an opinion on your application materials? We’d love to take a look (time permitting, of course).
So take a look through the sessions below and register today! (Yes, registration is required.) 
Please note: All times listed below are in Eastern Standard Time.


 
*It’s important to note that computer science at CMU isn’t a department within a larger college. We are an entire college (although we call ourselves the “School of Computer Science”). While we are close to our colleagues across the college - and know a good bit about who is interested in what - our department has its own specialties that we are well-positioned to discuss (namely Software Engineering and Societal Computing). If you are explicitly interested in another department - such as Machine Learning or Robotics, for example - we want you to know that you are still welcome to attend any of these sessions. Just understand that we may not be able to answer your questions as well as someone within those disciplines.
