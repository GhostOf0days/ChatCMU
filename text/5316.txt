Dynamixel MX-106R: 12 Volt, RS-485 controlled servo used to actuate Toms mouth (Servo #1), head tilt (Servo #2), and head turn (Servo #3) functions. Quantity in system: 3.
UltraMotion A series servo cylinder: 36 Volt, pulse width modulation controlled linear servo used to actuate Toms torso bend (Actuator #1) and scepter (actuator #2) functions. Quantity in system: 3.

Show Control

Weigl ProCommander 2 POSITIVE OUTPUT: The main show controller for Tom. Located in the existing Itec rack in the green room it receives ASCII TCP IP network messages from the PC connected to the touch screen and then plays back Toms stored show files located on a micro SD card inside it.
Weigl Pro I/O Servo 8: A break out box for the Pro Commander. Receives control data from ProCommander via ASCII TCP IP Protocol and converts and distributes it into control signal protocol that Toms servo’s and actuators communicate in, which are RS-485 and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Quantity in system: 2 (one operating and one as a backup).
Weigl Pro I/O DMX: A break out box for the Pro Commander. Recives control data from ProCommander via ASCII TCP IP Protocol and converts and distributes it into DMX signal that the lights in Tom’s Sceper communicate in. Quantity in system: 1.
Weigl Pro I/O Digital 32 PNP: A break out box for the Pro Commander. Receives control data from ProCommander via ASCII TCP IP Protocol and then switches PNP outputs to send 24V DC to the coil of of the main power relay in toms electrical panel and the E-Stop relay. Quantity in system: 1. Phoenix Contact

DMX Lights

RGB pixeldmx minidome 30 lights: 12V DC 0.8 Watt DMX controlled lights. The globe at the top of Tom’s Scepter contain a string of 20 of these units.
