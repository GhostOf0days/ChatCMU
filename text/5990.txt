As SAMS Scholars, students engage in a rigorous curriculum taught by our renowned faculty and staff who are deeply committed to student success. The program allows students to develop a deeper understanding of STEM via traditional classroom instruction, through hands-on projects, and sustained engagement with world-renowned faculty and skilled staff mentors. In addition to their academic experiences, students also have the opportunity to collaborate and develop meaningful relationships with peers from across the country.  Through SAMS and other outreach initiatives, the university:The Summer Academy for Math and Science will consist of 2 parts:PART 1: Part one of the SAMS program will occur prior to the start of the residential program (dates to be determined). This will be a virtual jumpstart for participants, focusing on some skill-building that will be needed for the in-person program. During this time the program will be connecting virtually for portions of these days, but students will not be needed for full days.  PART 2: Part two of the SAMS program will be a 5 week, in-person Pre-College program. Students will move into the residence halls on July 1st, and the first day of classes will be July 3rd. SAMS Scholars will be in courses and meetings for full days during the 5-weeks they are here. The academic portion of the program will conclude with the symposium on Friday, August 4th and students will move out of the residence halls on August 5th.SAMS is a fully funded, merit-based program. There is no cost for scholars to participate. We expect all SAMS 2023 Scholars to participate fully for the duration of the program. We understand that students may be applying to multiple Summer 2023 opportunities, however if selected for SAMS, scholars will not be permitted to participate in any other programs (virtual or in person) if program dates conflict.

 The Summer Academy for Math and Science (SAMS) provides opportunities for students from underrepresented communities to explore STEM-related fields.
 
 Program Overview
As SAMS Scholars, students engage in a rigorous curriculum taught by our renowned faculty and staff who are deeply committed to student success. The program allows students to develop a deeper understanding of STEM via traditional classroom instruction, through hands-on projects, and sustained engagement with world-renowned faculty and skilled staff mentors. In addition to their academic experiences, students also have the opportunity to collaborate and develop meaningful relationships with peers from across the country.  Through SAMS and other outreach initiatives, the university:

Develops a diverse and supportive community of STEM Scholars interested in attending top-tier universities.
Strengthens students’ commitment to pursuing STEM-related disciplines.
Broadens students understanding and access to opportunities made available through study in STEM.
Equips students with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to be successful STEM scholars.

Curriculum 
The Summer Academy for Math and Science will consist of 2 parts:
PART 1: Part one of the SAMS program will occur prior to the start of the residential program (dates to be determined). This will be a virtual jumpstart for participants, focusing on some skill-building that will be needed for the in-person program. During this time the program will be connecting virtually for portions of these days, but students will not be needed for full days.  
PART 2: Part two of the SAMS program will be a 5 week, in-person Pre-College program. Students will move into the residence halls on July 1st, and the first day of classes will be July 3rd. SAMS Scholars will be in courses and meetings for full days during the 5-weeks they are here. The academic portion of the program will conclude with the symposium on Friday, August 4th and students will move out of the residence halls on August 5th.
SAMS is a fully funded, merit-based program. There is no cost for scholars to participate. We expect all SAMS 2023 Scholars to participate fully for the duration of the program. We understand that students may be applying to multiple Summer 2023 opportunities, however if selected for SAMS, scholars will not be permitted to participate in any other programs (virtual or in person) if program dates conflict. If you have any questions, please reach out to cmu-sams@andrew.cmu.edu.

 The Summer Academy for Math and Science (SAMS) provides opportunities for students from underrepresented communities to explore STEM-related fields.
 
 Program Overview
As SAMS Scholars, students engage in a rigorous curriculum taught by our renowned faculty and staff who are deeply committed to student success. The program allows students to develop a deeper understanding of STEM via traditional classroom instruction, through hands-on projects, and sustained engagement with world-renowned faculty and skilled staff mentors. In addition to their academic experiences, students also have the opportunity to collaborate and develop meaningful relationships with peers from across the country.  Through SAMS and other outreach initiatives, the university:

Develops a diverse and supportive community of STEM Scholars interested in attending top-tier universities.
Strengthens students’ commitment to pursuing STEM-related disciplines.
Broadens students understanding and access to opportunities made available through study in STEM.
Equips students with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions to be successful STEM scholars.

Curriculum 
The Summer Academy for Math and Science will consist of 2 parts:
PART 1: Part one of the SAMS program will occur prior to the start of the residential program (dates to be determined). This will be a virtual jumpstart for participants, focusing on some skill-building that will be needed for the in-person program. During this time the program will be connecting virtually for portions of these days, but students will not be needed for full days.  
PART 2: Part two of the SAMS program will be a 5 week, in-person Pre-College program. Students will move into the residence halls on July 1st, and the first day of classes will be July 3rd. SAMS Scholars will be in courses and meetings for full days during the 5-weeks they are here. The academic portion of the program will conclude with the symposium on Friday, August 4th and students will move out of the residence halls on August 5th.
SAMS is a fully funded, merit-based program. There is no cost for scholars to participate. We expect all SAMS 2023 Scholars to participate fully for the duration of the program. We understand that students may be applying to multiple Summer 2023 opportunities, however if selected for SAMS, scholars will not be permitted to participate in any other programs (virtual or in person) if program dates conflict. If you have any questions, please reach out to cmu-sams@andrew.cmu.edu.
