The CMU Pantry Comic Book
 Not having enough nutritious food to eat is a problem many university students face on a regular basis. CMU is no exception.
In 2020, Gabi Maier, faculty member in CMU's modern languages department, and Cora Hickoff, School of Fine Arts alumna, created a CMU Pantry comic book as a fun way to educate students about the pantry.
The comic is based on 37 student interviews, conducted in the fall of 2019 by Gabi, that revealed a number of questions and concerns students had about CMU’s food pantry: What is the pantry What does it offer? Who is allowed to use it? Will I take away food from students who need it more than I do? 
The comic script is based on the interviews that Cora turned into a fully illustrated comic book.
Questions or comments about the comic? Contact Gabi Maier at eichgabi@andrew.cmu.edu or Cora Hickoff at corahickoff@gmail.com.
