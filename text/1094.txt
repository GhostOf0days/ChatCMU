“Hacking is like solving a puzzle. The person who solves it often gains a better understanding of the problem than its creator.” David Brumley, software security researcher in CyLab


“We hack because we care about security, and we want to protect people from potential threats by identifying problems systematically.” Yuan Tian, software security researcher in CyLab


“A world that uses facial recognition does not look like Hollywood’s Minority Report. It looks like a smarter, more pleasant experience interacting with complex computer security systems to help make a safer world for our friends, our families and our children.” Marios Savvides, director of CyLab’s Biometrics Center


“It would take people 244 hours per year to read all of the privacy policies at all of the websites they visit in one year. I study privacy policies, and I spend a lot of time reading them, and I do not spend 244 hours per year reading privacy policies.” Lorrie Cranor, director of the CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Lab


“There is much to gain and benefit from this massive analysis of personal information, or big data, but there are also complex tradeoffs that come from giving away our privacy.” Alessandro Acquisti, privacy researcher in CyLab
