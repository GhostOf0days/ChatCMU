 Utilities 

Internet
Wireless network access is available in on-campus residential buildings. Using the wireless connection is recommended to reduce overall university energy consumption. Ethernet (hard-wired) jacks are available in most on-campus units. Wired ports are turned off by default. If you need to use a wired connection, visit How to Connect to the Wired Network for more details. The Residence on Fifth, Fairfax Apartments, and Neville Apartments are completely wireless environments.
Cable
Residences located on campus include cable TV service in all student rooms. You will need to bring a cable-ready digital TV and a coaxial cable to connect.

Water, Sewage, Heat & Electricity
These utilities are among the services covered by the housing rates and are supplied to all university housing.
Air Conditioning
Some residences are air conditioned. If students need air conditioning in a residence without air conditioning for medical reason, please read the air conditioning section of the Housing policies.
 

 Space Reservations
The below spaces are available to students, staff, and faculty for use during the academic year. Reservations for these locations are honored on a first-come, first-served basis. Please email Residential Education with any inquiries.
Morewood Gardens Multipurpose Room

The Morewood Gardens Multipurpose room has a wooden floor, barre, and mirrored wall. It can be used for dance practice.
University departments and student organizations can request a reservation by contacting the Office of Residential Education at least 48 hours in advance of the requested reservation time. Reservations are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis and can be made for a one-time use or recurring use during the semester. Reservations are accepted for the current semester beginning at 8:30 am on the first day of classes. All reservations are canceled at the end of each semester. Your reservation is set until you receive a confirmation email from the Office of Residential Education.  
If you are not a Morewood Corridor resident (Morewood E-Tower, Morewood Gardens, Mudge House, Stever House, and the Greek Quad), you will need to request access to the Morewood Gardens front door in order to gain entry to the multi-purpose room. Those requests should be sent to housing@andrew.cmu.edu and resed@andrew.cmu.edu at least 48 hours (two business days) in advance of the reservation. If you will be holding an event and you are unsure of the attendee list, please identify a group leader to be given access who will be responsible for meeting the group in advance of entering the building.
Demand for using this space is high, so to accommodate as many requests as possible, students and organizations are limited to a maximum of two hours per day and a maximum of six hours per week. Please vacate the multipurpose room at least five minutes prior to the end of your reservation so the next group may begin using the space promptly at their reserved time.

West Wing Tech Lounge

The West Wing Tech Lounge is a meeting room that can accommodate up to 20 people.
University departments and student organizations can request a reservation by contacting the Office of Residential Education at least 48 hours in advance of the requested reservation time. Reservations are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis and can be made for a one-time use or recurring use during the semester. Reservations are available each year from early August through mid-May. All reservations are canceled at the end of each semester. Your reservation is not set until you receive a confirmation email from the Office of Residential Education.
Please notify Residential Education in advance of all cancellations. We expect that you will leave the room clean and remove all items that you bring into the space.

  
 Resident Communication
The Office of Residential Education is the hub for sharing information with students who live in our residence halls. If you are hosting a campus event and thinking about how to include residents in your program, we are glad to assist.
Weekly Announcement Emails

Each Monday afternoon, during the fall and spring semesters, a weekly announcement e-mail is sent to all students living in our residential communities. This email message is sent to Residential Education staff (Resident Assistants) who forwards it to their residents. The Announcement e-mail contains information about upcoming events sponsored by Carnegie Mellon recognized groups, organizations, departments or campus communities. 
To have an upcoming event included in the weekly announcement, please send an e-mail with detailed information, an image, and a short blurb by 5 p.m. on Friday. Information received after the deadline will be included in the following week's message, if applicable.
To subscribe or unsubscribe from the announcement e-mail list, please send an email with your name and contact information. 

Posters

The Office of Residential Education distributes posters to residential staff members for posting in campus residence halls. Posting is limited to Carnegie Mellon University recognized student organizations and University departments/programs only. We do not distribute materials for external sources or businesses. All posters must be approved for distribution by the Office of Residential Education.
Posters can be submitted for in-person approval at the Student Life Suite or by emailing the SLS office administrator. To ensure timely distribution, please secure approval and deliver posters to the Student Life Suite at least one week in advance of your promotion.

The below spaces are available to students, staff, and faculty for use during the academic year. Reservations for these locations are honored on a first-come, first-served basis. Please email Residential Education with any inquiries.
Morewood Gardens Multipurpose Room

The Morewood Gardens Multipurpose room has a wooden floor, barre, and mirrored wall. It can be used for dance practice.
University departments and student organizations can request a reservation by contacting the Office of Residential Education at least 48 hours in advance of the requested reservation time. Reservations are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis and can be made for a one-time use or recurring use during the semester. Reservations are accepted for the current semester beginning at 8:30 am on the first day of classes. All reservations are canceled at the end of each semester. Your reservation is set until you receive a confirmation email from the Office of Residential Education.  
If you are not a Morewood Corridor resident (Morewood E-Tower, Morewood Gardens, Mudge House, Stever House, and the Greek Quad), you will need to request access to the Morewood Gardens front door in order to gain entry to the multi-purpose room. Those requests should be sent to housing@andrew.cmu.edu and resed@andrew.cmu.edu at least 48 hours (two business days) in advance of the reservation. If you will be holding an event and you are unsure of the attendee list, please identify a group leader to be given access who will be responsible for meeting the group in advance of entering the building.
Demand for using this space is high, so to accommodate as many requests as possible, students and organizations are limited to a maximum of two hours per day and a maximum of six hours per week. Please vacate the multipurpose room at least five minutes prior to the end of your reservation so the next group may begin using the space promptly at their reserved time.

West Wing Tech Lounge

The West Wing Tech Lounge is a meeting room that can accommodate up to 20 people.
University departments and student organizations can request a reservation by contacting the Office of Residential Education at least 48 hours in advance of the requested reservation time. Reservations are scheduled on a first-come, first-served basis and can be made for a one-time use or recurring use during the semester. Reservations are available each year from early August through mid-May. All reservations are canceled at the end of each semester. Your reservation is not set until you receive a confirmation email from the Office of Residential Education.
Please notify Residential Education in advance of all cancellations. We expect that you will leave the room clean and remove all items that you bring into the space.
