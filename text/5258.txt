THIS WEEK (2/11/13 – 2/15/13)
Quarters Presentation
to the faculty. We expounded on our concept of having the guest to our website act as an investigative journalist who is delving into the subject of economic inequality in America. We also showed examples of what kinds of transmedia we have seen that has given us ideas for our project, as well as an interactive infographic that shows how we want to disseminate our data to the user.

Story Outline
Now that we have settled on a concept to pursue, we have gone ahead and started to work on the writing for the project. We are incorporating various infographics into the story, so the journalist will be interacting with them to do his or her research for the piece they will make at the end of the experience.
Client Meeting
On Thursday, we met with our client to hear their ideas on what should be worked on in the experience. Progress updates were exchanged during the meeting.
NEXT WEEK (2/18/13 – 2/22/13)
We are going to finalize the script and then begin shooting. Our mock-up of the website will continue to be constructed so that we will be able to playtest in the near-future. We will also find footage to make an intro video to the project that will address the issues at play in our experience.
